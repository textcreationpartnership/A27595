            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis Diſcourſe humbly dedicates it ſelf to you, having received Being from the Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe late Monuments of Divine Diſpleaſure, raiſed upon this Nation in General, and more directly over you. If you vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe it Acceptance and Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, you give it the advantage of that Hill, upon which ſo Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<pb facs="tcp:59784:3"/> a City is ſet, that it may not be hid in its own obſcurity. But as the great Tapers of Judgment, upon which it gazes, were thought fit to be exalted into ſo lofty a Candleſtick; which in lower places had been as under a Bed or Buſhel: So theſe Obſervations that would ſhine by their Beams, will be moſt happily fixed there, if it may be with your Favour and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance.</p>
            <p>There is nothing herein to plead ſo great a dignation from you, but,</p>
            <p>Firſt, an humble zeal to Divine Glory, the Counſel of which A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm darkens by words without knowledge; while it would ſet up petty Mechanicks of Evil at work in their dark ſhops, inſtead
<pb facs="tcp:59784:3"/> of that Almighty Hand, reaching down out of its own Heaven into this lower World, its own alſo: and in the room of that Jehovah, who knows no other beſides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in Heaven or Earth; or any that as he, creates good and evil; without whom no weapon formed to deſtroy, no Smith that blows in the coals for it, no waſter that uſes it, is erected.</p>
            <p>Secondly, an affection of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to you, expreſſing it ſelf in an endeavour to vindicate your Calamities out of all ſuch rude, black, dark Lanthorn-hands, and to ſurrender them into his; by whom to be chaſtiſed without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, how ſeverely ſoever, is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable; but by any other, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile and abject.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:59784:4"/>
            <p> From this Hand, even when it ſmites, if it be humbly and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantly turned to, drops a Balm that heals, and an Oyl of excellent kindneſs diſtils, that doth not break our heads, but ſoften our hearts: An Unguent that doth not only embalm us for ſuffering, but anoint us for Holineſs and Happineſs. This Rod, after it hath ſtricken, if it be accepted, bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms in a night, and ſuddenly flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes with the peaceable fruits of Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>He that touches an affliction im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after God, by ſaith and obedience to the ends of it, ſhall find his fingers dropping with the ſweet-ſmelling Mirrhe: but taken out of any other Forge, there is nothing to be felt, but the cold
<pb facs="tcp:59784:4"/> Iron prepared to miſchief, and the impurity of it ſelf, and the offices through which it hath paſſed.</p>
            <p>He that aſcribes our Ruines to any but God, ſows them with ſalt and barrenneſs; he that aſſures them from him; gives us the upper and neither Springs of gracious motion to God, and Bleſſing from him.</p>
            <p>All Paraphraſes upon our Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings out of the Atcheiſts Chair, are as the Corn that withereth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it groweth up, wherewith the Mower filleth not his hand, nor he that bindeth ſheaves his Boſom; nor do any ſay, We bleſs you in the Name of the Lord: The true Interpretations of them lead us out to ſow indeed in tears, but that we may reap in joy; that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:59784:5"/> forth, and bearing precious ſeed, we may come again rejoyce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and bring our ſheaves with us. Who would not then chuſe to find himſelf fallen into the hands of God, with whom tender mercies dwell, and gracious purpoſes mollifie the greateſt rigours; as the harſhneſs of medicaments is overcome with the ſweetneſs of the health they deſign?</p>
            <p>Who? except the ſtupid Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, the Atheiſtick contemner of God and his Hand, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Senſualiſt, the hardned Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent, who hates to be reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and therefore all evils upon them are the Brands of an Eternal Judgment, and print Hell upon their fleſh; the private marks of which are firſt upon their Souls.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:59784:5"/>
            <p> But you, who have a wiſe and grave apprehenſion of all things, much more of thoſe wherein you are concerned with God; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in his ſolemn interviews with you, though of Judgment, will give Glory to him, by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments, It is the Lord; and therefore will not walk con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to him, but ſearching where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he hath been diſhonoured, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in denying that Amplitude, and Example to Religion, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing freedoms to evil, will turn to him, by reducing things to an order, beſeeming Humiliation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Hand; both within your private Walls, and in your more publick Adminiſtrations.</p>
            <p>And this not only from Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of ſelf-preſervation, but out of
<pb facs="tcp:59784:6"/> Gratitude, and love to thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſions, which interpoſed, that you ſhould not be utterly conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, as <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> by a Judgment that ſo nearly reſembled theirs.</p>
            <p>From which compaſſions thoſe vigorous deſignations and daily ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing hopes of a new City, are now receiving life, which make this a fit ſeaſon to preſent you theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, ſeeing a holy Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of paſſed Judgments is the beſt kind of <hi>Teleſma</hi> againſt future Evils.</p>
            <p>Now that Ruler of all the World, whoſe goings out are from everlaſting, who of old laid the Foundations of this City, who proſpered it into its late Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, who derived upon it the
<pb facs="tcp:59784:6"/> confluence of that wealth, adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Ingeny, Arts, and Learning of the whole World; decorated it with a Civick Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; even to Majeſty, ennobled it with the Thrones of <hi>England:</hi> who lately in righteous Judgment for ſin, humbled, laid it low, even with the ground, that it yet ſits (but brooding) upon its own aſhes; raiſe it again out of them, increaſe the Glory of it ſeven-fold along ſucceeding Ages, draw it out of the fire a veſſel of Honour refined, make his Church in it a brighteſt Candleſtick of the Goſpel of Peace, after it hath been a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain burning with fire, that could not be touched; create a new Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth in it, wherein Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs may dwell, after this

            <head>The General Addreſs.</head>
            <p>THere is a Spirit in Man, that within the Sphere wherein he moves, is very curious and inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to underſtand, how things are carried, and what is done, or falls out in the world; and when he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves any thing new or great, his Inquiries ſtay not in the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but rifle them for the cauſes and ſprings of them.</p>
            <p>This men do agreeably to their Elevation and Compaſs, even from thoſe that reſide in the higher and vaſter Orbs of Government, down to thoſe that are circumſcribed within the narrowneſſes of meaner conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: who yet not only ſtretch them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves round their own little circles,
<pb facs="tcp:59784:8"/> but aſcend as high, and run out as far as they can into what is above and beyond them.</p>
            <p>Who of any largeneſs of mind, would have the great Revolutions in any part of the world concealed from him? Men of a very common ſize of Soul are acquainted with the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their own Nation; and they who are crowded up in the leaſt room of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, comprehend the things of their neighbourhood, and the Periodical changes of the State they live under.</p>
            <p>Herein wiſe men caſt themſelves backward upon former times, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire a knowledge from Hiſtory, much elder then themſelves, praedate their lives to the oldeſt moments, by their reſearches what was done in them, their Judgment upon, and affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb facs="tcp:59784:8"/> Sympathies therewith. Again they throw themſelves forward upon Futurity by all ways of Divination poſſible; but how much more do they ſettle upon their own Center of Time; and in that, the freſh and new emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies challenge their moſt conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable thoughts: wherein they reſt not in the bare Events, but are earneſt to know the bottom and reaſon of them; and to ſound their Original as far as they can; and this every one doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the innate ſagacity or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved obſervation he hath attained.</p>
            <p>Thus that natural examinative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of man pierces every way to its utmoſt poſſibility.</p>
            <p>Now all this ſo far, as ingraffed ſenſe of a God, or the Diſcipline of Religion, hath its effect upon the Soul, turns it ſelf to God, to obſerve the daily occurrents of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb facs="tcp:59784:9"/> and the Magnificencies of his Power, either in mercy or wrath; and comparing one thing with another, makes a Character of the times, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thoſe ſigns imprinted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them by the Divine Hand.</p>
            <p>Where this is not done, it is a neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence ſo ſupine, and contemptful of God, that our Saviour rebukes it from the moſt ordinary marks of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane attention, which is often more bold and prying then becomes it; and yet diſſembles and pretends a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, when it is called to underſtand God and his doings.</p>
            <p>He then that hath not viewed the bulk or extern preſence of the late Judgments of God upon <hi>England,</hi> muſt either be an utter ſtranger to it, or to whatever is called Man.</p>
            <p>He that hath not particularly, and with an inquiſitiveneſs agreeable to

            <p>This following Diſcourſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes to no more, then to give occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to theſe native exerciſes of men, concerning the Judgments of God in General, and then to incline them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the particulars ſo freſh upon us.</p>
            <p>Firſt, to bring to their view thoſe ſo notable Events of the late years,
<pb facs="tcp:59784:10"/> that they may know of them, whether they are things of every day; which beſides the common work hath upon ſome parts of it theſe huge Balls fixed, beſides the natural curling of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

            <p>That they were very portentous, the very amazed concernedneſs of all ſorts of men about them demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and after-Hiſtory will in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting them, take that ſtate to it ſelf, which it aſſumes in relation of greater things.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To propoſe to their Reaſon, whether they are not moſt juſtly own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him that made and governs the world; and whether there is not as great reaſon to acknowledge the one to him, as the other.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, to adviſe with their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, whether if Judgments of
<pb facs="tcp:59784:10"/> God, they are not the moſt perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Interceſſors of Repentance and Amendment of life to this whole Nation: ſeeing the reaſons why ſo gracious a Power puniſhes, are ſins; and if theſe continue, the executions of Judgment muſt riſe higher, till they ſwell into deſtruction, or eternal wrath: except he that is the Author of them were ſuſpected of weakneſs of Counſel, to do ſo great things to no purpoſe, or want of power to furniſh him with means to purſue his end.</p>
            <p>Which conſideration, if lively applied, would be moſt conſtraining of our humbleſt and moſt penitent ſupplications and returns to God; both out of love to him, who having ſo great a reach over us, would make us better, and not deſtroy us, and out of love to our ſelves, that we may not by further provoking him, even ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitate
<pb facs="tcp:59784:11"/> him to our ruine.</p>
            <p>For though we cannot abat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> that bleſſed Being ſo far, as to impute to him the paſſions and diſcompoſures of anger; but remove from him the trouble and diſquiet that enter into Humane Indignations: yet we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo much diminiſh from his own expreſſions of his wrath, but to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the effects of it much more real, then thoſe of created diſpleaſures, how many wiſdoms and methods ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they run through.</p>
            <p>And though we own him above, and without extern cauſe; yet we muſt acknowledge according to the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations he hath made, he doth with the higheſt freedoms of his own will, and a tranquillity infinitely agreeing with his eternally happy condition, execute puniſhments upon ſinners according to his Laws: even as
<pb facs="tcp:59784:11"/> a juſt Prince ſuffers procedures of Juſtice againſt Offenders without any diſturbance or paſſion upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; more, then that he delights not in the miſery of his Subjects, but cannot becauſe of that, bend Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs from its own exaltneſs; though he is ſtill ready to moderate it by pardons upon becoming reaſons: Even as there are in God the relent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his infinite Goodneſs at the ſorrows and contri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ions of humbled ſinners.</p>
            <p>Now in theſe conſiderations lye the great obligations of Repentance, and invitations to it, exciting the moſt powerful Principles of ſelf-preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and more ingenuous affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in mans Soul, and apprehending the moſt advantagious handles of it, Love and Fear.</p>
            <p>Such an Appeal then, as this to
<pb facs="tcp:59784:12"/> men, to uſe their own ſentiments in things of ſo clear an importance, ought to be made to every one, but with more particular addreſs to the Heroes of the Nation, whoſe <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and Virtue amplified with the Advantages of Government and Condition, ſet them upon the higher riſings of the world, and give them the freeſt proſpect upon all things; from whence they diſcover not only ſecondary expedients of the Common Peace and Weal, but alſo if theſe are governed by piety, they will find thoſe primer ones, the worthier Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of conciliating the Divine Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
            <p>Such as do this, extend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves beyond Demeſtick Bleſſings, and become the Publick Good; who having an Intereſt and Example to ſpread, and Influences to derive, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate
<pb facs="tcp:59784:12"/> them to God, and the good ſtate of a Nation with him; that as their opportunities of knowledge are moſt open, their Intereſts wideſt, and their ſenſes of evil quickeſt; ſo their endeavours againſt that ſin which ruines Kingdoms, and for that piety that exalts them, is moſt earneſt.</p>
            <p>When perſwaſions of Reformation find freeſt entertainment with thoſe who have moſt power to promote it, and Princes are not only Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, but Divines, publiſhing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Amendment of life, by thoſe Soveraign Documents, the face of their Authority and Example ſhining upon Holineſs; how orderly doth this Reformation deſcend from the Superior Regions? without that tumult and ſuſpition of Deſign that uſually accompanies Popular At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts therein; and with greateſt
<pb facs="tcp:59784:13"/> Honour: For ſuch being nearer God, the Original of all, we accept from them recommendations of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as Acts of Bounty with thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs; but not without diſdain and regret from them below us: There being ever an exprobration in that inverſion of Order and Nature, when we receive the light or dew of Heaven from beneath, that ſhould come down from above to us.</p>
            <p>It muſt needs be a Rebuke from Heaven upon the upper world, when in the ſilence of Religion, Judgment, and Equity there, God opens the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar mouths to call for them; and yet if theſe ſhould hold their peace, there is ſo great a conſtraint for the want, that even the ſtones would cry out.</p>
            <p>The Reaſon that forſakes men, tranſmigrates as it were into inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things: <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Wiſdom ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb facs="tcp:59784:13"/> ſo contrived, that as the neglect goes down lower and lower; things loweſt ſhould be moved to convince them above, till the nethermoſt foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the Earth are ſtirred to reprove diſobedient man, though at the other higher end of it.</p>
            <p>When the Seats of Dignity are empty (that is) not filled with good Government, who is not ready to preſs into them? and when the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets Chairs are unfurniſhed by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of graver inveſtiture, naked <hi>Sauls</hi> crowd into them; as they ſay, Nature ſwells out of its place to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent vacuity.</p>
            <p>Or rather the plenitude of wiſdom, that flows from God the Fountain, is ſo immenſe, that being excluded its proper place, as a full ſtream for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced out of its own Channel, it burſts into another, or overflows all; or
<pb facs="tcp:59784:14"/> like the Apoſtles Doctrine, which driven from the Jews, expatiated upon the Gentiles.</p>
            <p>But theſe extravaſations are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in themſelves dangerous, if not deadly; this Wiſdom never ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf out of the reſidences it hath choſen, as fitteſt for it, but in wrath; when it ſpeaks by men of low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er rank, what it would do by Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors; or by the Creatures, what men ſhould underſtand themſelves: It is in Judgment to forbid their madneſs.</p>
            <p>May it then be the Happineſs of our Times and Nation, to be reſcued from the further purſuits of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine diſpleaſure, by the mediation of perſonages of place, and lawful ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages, that have not taken their Honour to themſelves, or by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation of God thruſt into it.</p>

            <head>CHAP. I. <hi>A Prefatory Diſcourſe, ſhewing the Excellency of Scripture in diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering to us that Judgments are from God, and leading us from Atheiſm to the true uſe of them.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT hath pleaſed God to caſt us into thoſe times wherein Atheiſtick Opinions, as well as Practices, have dared a conteſt with his Judgments: That the boldneſs of either Monſter, ſpeculative or practick Atheiſm, ſhould be permitted to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, or over-grow ſuch convictions of his hand lifted up, as we have had, is by every good man as earneſtly to be deprecated, and with as great a compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Age in which he lives to be born off, as a common Ruine. For all Judgments being the ſtrange Acts of God, and thoſe we have felt, the moſt
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59784:21"/> unuſual of thoſe ſtrange Acts, they come near Miracles, and are like his finger on <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and the Jews; and therefore to impute them to Chance, or Nature, or any thing below God, comes alſo too near their debaſement of Divine Power, and aſcribing it to <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> that they might not be conſtrained to ſubmit to it: A ſin that our Saviour tells us, is not forgiven in this world; which ſounds more to ſuch kind of men, then to add, Nor in the world to come. This were indeed to be delivered up to a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate ſenſe, which is the greateſt of Judgments, and precedes deſtruction: It being very rare, that God ſuffers himſelf, and the Majeſty he carries in the world, to be trodden under foot, when he hath begun the aſſertions of them; but that leſſer ſtrokes (which are Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline) ceaſing, the fatal blow follows: when the wind, to fan and cleanſe, lies without ſucceſs, the dry wind from the wilderneſs, that blaſts and withers all, ſoon after riſes; when God thinks it vain, men ſhould be ſtricken any more, becauſe they revolt more and more, and will not ſo much as owne him that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59784:21"/> ſtrikes; he then ſtrikes once for all, and affliction riſes not up the ſecond time.</p>
            <p>It is neceſſary then, all that have to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a ſenſe of God and Publick good, ſhould interpoſe againſt thoſe idle words that corrupt good manners, that diſ-entitle God to our calamities, and ſo enfeeble all thoſe inferences of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, that are deducible from the acknowledgment of him as the Author; and alſo againſt thoſe evil manners that ariſe and corrupt Communications, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nothing elſe for their ſecurity, but to plead, that God doth neither good nor evil.</p>
            <p>Now theſe things diſtil firſt from the upper ſort of men, who having the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to build their luſts above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſcrew up by themſelves, or the miniſtery of ſervile wits, a falſified rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to the height of thoſe luſts; whence they fall upon the lower world, which as greedily, though not with ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of ſenſuality, drinks them in.</p>
            <p>This following Diſcourſe is therefore levelled to this end; that every man of all ſorts owning his hand, may make no doubt, but his Kingdom hath come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59784:22"/> us in his late dreadful Providences, and ſo may give glory to him.</p>
            <p>The grounds of it are, that reaſon of Scripture, which being the Book of God, gives the Hiſtory of the Government and Acts of God in the world. For as the Records of any Nation or Prince, are to be found with their proper Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, and we ſeek them with moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and ſucceſs, where the accounts of them are profeſſedly offered: Even ſo the digeſts of Holy writing render us the beſt aſſurances of God in the world, and aſcribe to him that which is his own, with greateſt ſincerity.</p>
            <p>Though therefore there are many confeſſions to God from the light of Nature, and its Prophets; yet thoſe whom God himſelf deputed to the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of himſelf, are much more to be truſted, carrying along with them a clear, conſtant, and even Tenor of Truth.</p>
            <p>And the Examples he ſingles out to demonſtrate his own Dominion, Juſtice, or Goodneſs in the world, are much fairer then thoſe that are forreign to the Scripture. Even as a wiſe Reaſoner makes
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59784:22"/> choice of the beſt Arguments; when an ordinary Diſputer, though he may fall upon ſuch as have truth, yet not upon thoſe that are moſt cogent.</p>
            <p>To us, to whom the Word of God is the meaſure and fountain of Truth, all its affirmations are demonſtrations: Its repeated inculcating and exemplifying of things in matters of Fact, are like ſtrongeſt concatenations of reaſon.</p>
            <p>Yet as God often took the Pagan world within the Verge of his Word, and extended the line of Prophecy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the utmoſt diſtant earth, therein at once laying fuller aſſurances of himſelf for his own people, and advantages of acknowledging him, for the uſe of thoſe that were not yet proſelyted to him: Which Word (beſides the authority of, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord)</hi> carries alſo a high hand of reaſon and evidence along with it; that if any would but ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves men, they muſt needs be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by it. Even ſo may we make uſe of all reaſons to confirm the faith of them who firſt reſt it in Scripture; and to compel thoſe to bow to what it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, who think not themſelves obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59784:23"/> to believe Oracles, though Divine, where they are not ſupported and poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by thoſe Ratiocinations, wherein they put more truſt.</p>
            <p>While then we center upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations of God, &amp; upon them endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to compaſs all that is indeed ſound, we ſhall find whatever is fit to argue us into that wiſdom &amp; ſeriouſneſs to which ſo awful a hand hath ſummoned us.</p>
            <p>In evincing the reaſonableneſs of our grand Poſition, That God is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all our calamities, we have this ſingular advantage, that every ſtep we take in acquitting it from utter impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and unreaſonableneſs, is in the place of a great reaſon. For it being carried in the high ſtream of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinds conſent, it is moſt rational it ſhould be accepted wherein it cannot be convicted of popular errour and miſtake: whereas Atheiſm herein hath nothing to ſettle upon, but a wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs generally condemned (even by the very Atheiſt, that aſſumes Morality) and a reaſon unſtamped, unauthorized by ſuffrage. It muſt therefore have ſo great a validity of Demonſtration, as
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59784:23"/> may be accepted for it ſelf; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indeed impoſſible to be found, the field muſt be left to that victorious Truth, and every man obliged to that Duty and Repentance it calls for. In which laſt particular, the very enemy of it be friends it; for as if it were clear, there were a God, the Atheiſt that would ſeem juſt and impartial to all things, and avoids the ſuſpition of chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his Opinion from his life, profeſſes he would turn the force of his reaſon for Religion and Service to the Deity: Even ſo, if all we ſuffer be from God, he will ſay, It is moſt neceſſary we ſhould by all means agreeable to his Nature, make it our buſineſs to appeaſe him; wherein the practical Atheiſt is deſerted by the Contemplator againſt a God and his Providence, and left alone as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon moſt unreaſonable, and deſperately forſaken of all ſenſe; who owning ſo great a Principle, governs not himſelf with conformity to it.</p>
            <p>But we are in no want of Conceſſions from Atheiſm, nor from ſo much as bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter taught Morality, though we thus ſpeak. For in points of Reaſon and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
<pb facs="tcp:59784:24"/> that anointing of the Spirit of God in his Word, leads the humble Chriſtian into all truth, and is it ſelf truth, who hath therefore no need that any ſhould teach him; yet he accepts the tributes of ſubordinate underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo. In hiſtorical accounts the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Chronology hath days enough to ſpeak to us, and years to teach us that knowledg that grows from matters of Fact, though all ſtory may ſerve it as a Commentary.</p>
            <p>In the Principles of holy and wiſe practice, we need not the Ciſterns that are broken and often foul, having the fountains of living water, and the Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal Sea it ſelf; yet we may allow, that as all waters, ſo far as they are wholſom, come from this Sea, they ſhould with a percolation return thither again.</p>
            <p>In all theſe, whatever we receive from the words of God is genuine, and of the true alloy, purified ſeven times; which the moſt ſublimated Moraliſt hath only in the Ore, ignorant of the true Arts of Refinement.</p>
            <p>All accounts from thence are ſteddy, even, and uniform with themſelves,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59784:24"/> their path pondered, and their eye ſtrait before them; compared with theſe, all others are giddy, diſtracted and uncertain; when they have ſpoken like wiſe men in ſome things, that Spirit of Truth and Wiſdom not inhabiting them, they fall into the wildneſſes of mad men, and the impertinencies of Fools; whence all the ſuperſtition that hath been in the world, hath continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſprung.</p>
            <p>In Scripture all things are full, and to the height; but in others ſcanty, and below the true elevation. For though they ſpeak at any time that is great and worthy God, conſidered by it ſelf, yet not like his Servant <hi>Job:</hi> They know not, nor can pronounce the great Tetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grammaton, the Euſebeia of the Goſpel, nor the true Evangelick Righteouſneſs and ſoberneſs: What they diſcourſe is either ſo thin and airy through Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick attenuation, that it loſes its weight and ſubſtance, its uſefulneſs and intelligibility to common capacity, or elſe it is too thick and groſs. Scripture knows only to ſpeak plainly, yet moſt divinely.</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:59784:25"/>
            <p> Of moſt things that have only ſome imperfect reſemblances, and half expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, Scripture is only able to interpret to them their Prophetick Dreams of Divine matters, as <hi>Daniel</hi> to <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar;</hi> which by its explanations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come excellent ſenſe.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, holy Oracles are the natural Soil, the native Country of all Divine truths; tranſplanted from them into more rigid and barren ground, they loſe their firſt ſweetneſs; or as Colonies ſent from it, they forget their Mother-City, the true <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and by length of time grow firſt ſtrange, then inimick, till by a captivation and recovery of them, as ſpoils taken by the Sword and Bow of Original truth, they are redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, inſtructed in their own deſcent, and reſtored to their noble alliances.</p>
            <p>Thus Religion draws home all thoſe branches and ſtems of it ſelf, from thoſe artificial Roots, upon which they grew weakly, or degenerated through the unnaturalneſs of the moiſture conveyed to them from falſe Principles; although if they might have had their own force and vigour, they would have meliorated
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59784:25"/> the worſe, but being over-power'd, they loſe their own excellency.</p>
            <p>But from this general Diſcourſe of Scripture, we return to the particular caſe; the fulneſs and ſufficiency of it to teach every man concerning the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, what he is to know and to do touching their revolutions in the world.</p>
            <p>Herein the Fundamental Doctrines, plain Precepts, Promiſes, Comminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons there to be found, lead us to actions great and ſerious; even as the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments themſelves, which are the moſt ſolemn of Providences; all procedures of Juſtice carrying along with them high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt gravity, and requiring a ſuitable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence. And becauſe we ſee them beſt in Examples, which are admonitions taken out of words, and printed into things; we upon whom the ends of the world are come, are made to ſit upon the ſhoulders of former times, through the favour of Scripture-hiſtory, beholding the Saints of God in their holy, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and heavenly demeanour in bad times, and their happy iſſue out of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation: On the other ſide, the miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59784:26"/> of obſtinate men, with their ſad Fates; that whoſo is wiſe to obſerve thoſe things, and prudent to know them, may underſtand, The ways of the Lord are right, and that men up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and ſtraight in themſelves, may walk in them; but tranſgreſſors, whoſe feet are crooked, their motions indirect, and they froward in all their paths, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hold themſelves on ſo ſtrait a line, but fall therein.</p>

            <head>CHAP. II. <hi>An Explanation of the Nature of Judgments.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THe Judgments of God are like another Volumn of his Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ks, fitted firſt for our contemplation; <hi>As the inviſible things of him from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world, are clearly ſeen, being underſtood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead:</hi> ſo are the ſame arrayed in juſtice and righteouſneſs, apparent in thoſe that are as it were unmade, and decreated in his wrath. For ſeeing that immenſe Eſſence cannot be comprehended in his own
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59784:26"/> Globe of light and purity, we need all the refractions he is pleaſed to make of himſelf, that we may underſtand him. Theſe of his wrath, which is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs provoked by ſin, declare that part of his glory: and there is no ſpeech or language where their voice is not heard. For their line is gone out through all the Earth, and their words to the ends of the world. In them hath he ſet a Tabernacle for his Juſtice, which rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth as a ſtrong man to run his race, and the acts of it in their ſeaſon are new eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry morning. For they are as the light that goeth forth.</p>
            <p>Before we enter into the Rational parts of this Diſcourſe, let us ſtand and behold the ſtate and order of Judgments as in Theory.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Judgments are thoſe evils that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the ſtandard vanity and vexation of ſpirit, that are the every days com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of the whole Creation, rational, ſenſitive, and inſenſate, in their ſeveral kinds of deploration of themſelves. For theſe are the Covenant made with all things after the Fall, and as it were the very terms and conditions upon which
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59784:27"/> they ſtand in the world, and not new things under the Sun to move wonder and ſearch: Yea that death and diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution into which every thing below the Heavens ſinks, either by degrees, or una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares, and is loſt in that dark, amounts not to the nature of what we call Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but moves with life in ſuch a kind of even viciſſitude, as day and night, and inter-changes with as little noiſe.</p>
            <p>But Judgments are the hand of God lifted up to ſhew a greater indignation. The former are indeed the angry prints and Characters of a ſetled Juſtice, that reſts and fixes upon that radical pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and evil of mans nature, and keeps pace and conſtant motion with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual actuations of it.</p>
            <p>But as there is a difference between the diſtempered ſtate and corruption of Mankind, with its ſcintillations, as from a perpetual fire, and more notorious enormities; ſo is there between the unintermitted diſcipline that chaſtiſes man, as a Creature out of the firſt favor and grace with God, and thoſe more terrible approaches, when he comes out
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59784:27"/> of his place, and does his ſtrange work upon ſinners, that they dye not the common deaths of men.</p>
            <p>Yet in both theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> natural cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and conſtant infelicity, lye the ſeeds and matter; which being either ſuddenly blown up, or by degrees ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together, ſwell high in an inſtant, or with leiſure grow to a ſum corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponding each other.</p>
            <p>For as depraved Nature breaks out into outragious impiety, or by repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed acts of it ſelf, riſes to its meaſure; ſo it is anſwered by God with ſudden Thunder-claps of his wrath, or the bringing out thoſe Treaſures, that by daily additions have been amaſſed, and are iſſued out in the juſt ſeaſons ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by him.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, as there are many excellent Rules of Religion and Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity conſiſtent with the one, which do not only govern particular perſons, who are Heroick herein, but ſpread them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by wholſome Laws and Counſels upon Communities, and adorn the Chronicle of that Age, of which they have firſt been the ſtability: ſo are there
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59784:28"/> great accounts of the goodneſs of God contemporary with the other, and rich acts of his bounty, which do moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently bleſs whole Nations as well as perſons, and recommend the times cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent over them to poſterity, as proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and happy: but all the whole world is neither acquitted from this guilt of univerſal corruption, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from the miſery ſo cloſely wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven into every ſtate of it.</p>
            <p>This condition of the world hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven occaſion to great inquiries, how it lapſed into it; ſome reſolution of which is hereafter intended: but now we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve how much even this differs from the more tumultuous and diſſoluted appearance of things under Judgment, when a reſemblance of the Garden of <hi>Eden</hi> becomes a Wilderneſs, and what we now call Proſperity, is clouded with over-ruling adverſity. We come into the world, and finding it as it is in its moſt conſtant eſtate, think it was never better, till by way of negation, remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the evils we perceive to be ſuch, and <hi>viâ eminentiae,</hi> meaſuring how much higher things might have been, we aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59784:28"/> in our thoughts to the firſt perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. But Judgments, without any ſuch circuit or elaboration, are down-right proofs of wrath and miſery, and that things are not as they were deſigned to be.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The intention of this Diſcourſe is eſpecially to obſerve Judgments, as they comprehend Nations, and infold Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities: For though God viſits ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcureſt perſons, and Families with them, yet they renown themſelves by their large ſpread upon greater pieces of the world, and the ſtretch of themſelves upon Thrones, Cities, and Countries, over which they draw the line of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and deſolation; in ſo much that their deſcriptions are proportionable to that general diſſolution of all things, at the end of the world: of which they are indeed ſmaller Maps and prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory introductions. The Prophet fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling theſe, ſpeaks in a language pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the day of Judgment; when the mountains ſhall tremble out of their places, and the foundations of the earth diſcover themſelves; the Sun and Moon reſign their light, and the Stars
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59784:29"/> forſake their Orbs, and fall from their Heaven. All which ſolemnities are borrowed to repreſent the down-fall and judgment of particular places and Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>While we conſider them thus, they are upon a hill, and fitter for general obſervation, as being more publick, and inſtructions from them more compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive; though the ſame reaſons have place, and like admonitions ariſe from the hand of God, however it plants it ſelf, or grounds its work, if the motions of it fall under our view, and offer themſelves to our notice.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Theſe Evils ariſe ſometimes from Nature turned out of its courſe, and loſing that poiſe God hath with greateſt wiſdom given it; from whence come all thoſe inequalities and intempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that produce Famines, Peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Earthquakes, Storms, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luges.</p>
            <p>For when all things were ſetled by God in number, weight and meaſure, for the advantage of the world, and welfare of the whole Creation; there neceſſarily follows, when they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59784:29"/> ruine and miſery, according to the degrees of the diſorder, both through the ceſſation of that benefit, their right courſe carried with it; and alſo through the violence of cauſes out of their places, and thoſe exorbitant motions which are the fury and rage of Nature.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe, there are alſo the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible conflicts of the luſts and paſſions of men ſtriving upon the great Sea of the world, roaring like Thunder, flaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like Lightning, tearing more gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily then Tempeſts, and that put all things into greater Convulſions then Earthquakes.</p>
            <p>There are no greater evils upon Mankind, then thoſe of which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is the Engineer; Blood, War, Rapine, and Terror devouring without mercy, are bred in his own bowels, and executed by himſelf, being the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates of thoſe fiery exhalations which ariſe from his unruly Soul. From whence come wars and fightings among you? Come they not hence? Even from your luſts, that war in your members? And theſe often introduce
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59784:30"/> as ſuddenly and inevitably thoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines and Peſtilences, which come more kindly out of the hand of what in this caſe we ſtyle Nature. Throughout Scripture, and all Hiſtory, we find God in juſtice uſing man againſt himſelf, and creating him the ſevereſt enemy of his own kind. He proſecutes peccant Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Nations, by ſome others that are fitted to bring to paſs his righteous ends, being no leſs under him, then the ſeveral Creatures that ſeem more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately his inſtruments, and the reins of which are acknowledged in his hand, to turn them every way as he pleaſes.</p>
            <p n="4">4. All theſe we define to be Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; that is, They come upon the world through the deſign and counſel of the ſupreme Cauſe of all things, God himſelf; and are neither Revolutions, that arriving at ſuch a Period, muſt needs ſhew themſelves like Eclipſes in ſuch a Nodus; or accidental and even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things, that through long toſſes of them hither and thither, fall out and happen to be, and by conſtant throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, hit ſometimes thus, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times otherwiſe: But they are the moſt
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59784:30"/> mature and ſage determinations of an infinite mind and underſtanding; that though he cuts the lines of his own mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions often, and labyrinths them through one another, ſo that we can find no certain path; yet will he at laſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt all he diſpoſes, to the conviction of the whole world. And yet we ſtay not here, but purſue the ſenſe of this awful word, Judgments; in w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the Scripture comparing ſpiritual and divine things with themſelves, ſo much delights. They are the execution of a juſt and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sentence of God upon the evil acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of man, according to Laws of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable equity; wherein his own glory and the trueſt peace of the whole Creation lye together concerned (the eſtabliſhment of Order and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment requiring ſo neceſſarily the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of ſin) ſo that they are neither the diſplays of his meer pleaſure, or the <hi>Arcana Imperii,</hi> the Cabals of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion or Rule of the world; but the preſence of his infinite Juſtice, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction over all things, how much ſoever the adminiſtration of ſo great an Empire falls within it; which doth
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59784:31"/> certainly conſpire herein: as is hereafter to be ſhewn.</p>

            <head>CHAP. III. <hi>An Endeavour to demonſtrate by ſound Reaſon, That Judgments are from God.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THe great matter of debate we are firſt to take notice of in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count we have given of Judgments, is, That they are from the infinite Wiſdom &amp; Counſel of God, carrying a courſe of Juſtice in the world: which is eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by theſe following perſwaſions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By thoſe reaſons and aſſurances we have for the truth of the Scriptures, all which muſt needs come home to the proof of what they do moſt induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly aſſert and teach, and which they make ſo great a point of their Doctrine. To every one that acknowledges them the Word of God, it is out of all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, that all the evil that is in the City is to be aſcribed to his directing and over-ruling hand, who forms the light of proſperity, and creates the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59784:31"/> darkneſs of adverſity; and that this he doth for the puniſhment of ſin. Since then ſo great and weighty moments of reaſon have been inſiſted upon by thoſe who have placed their labours in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrating the truth of Scripture; and the ſenſe of that in this caſe, among all the Diſputes that have been raiſed out of it, hath not been called into queſtion (except by men deprived of common underſtanding) we may challenge all that reaſon to our ſelves in aſſuring this Principle. But further then this. All thoſe inſtructions which are ſo plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully given us in Holy Writing, and wherein it travels ſo earneſtly to direct us into the right bearing and removing theſe preſſures, would be altogether unuſeful and vain, if God were not the Author of them: For to thoſe that remove him out of this Province, fatal Nature or Chance ſeem with moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of reaſon to be appointed over it: All inviſible Beings guided by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence and Will, are as dreadful to them, as Spectres to Children, both for the evidence they give to a Spiritual world, and the Scale that leads up from
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59784:32"/> them to God as their ſupreme Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.</p>
            <p>But who that is wiſe, would ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to appeaſe, or exorate a marble and inſenſible Fate, or compound with a giddy Chance that knew nothing of what they did before, nor ſo much as when it is come to paſs; that are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and uncertain what will be done next? being ſuch kind of cauſes, that neither govern; for that were an act of reaſon; nor are governed; for that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports a reaſon over them. Yet theſe nor knowing, nor willing any thing, nor able to either, are ſuppoſed to have this ſo great Principality over all; which makes it impoſſible, that we ſhould with any hope of benefit endeavour to move them towards us. But when a mind obſerves a mind; an inferior and ſubject mind, Man, the higheſt and moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent mind, God; there is greateſt reaſon to uſe all ways to find out the meaning of that moſt righteous and holy underſtanding, and to approach his ends with humbleſt proſtrations of Soul, ſeeking his face, and the returns of his mercy: much more then, when
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59784:32"/> among men one mind underſtands, and in caſes of difficulty, even divines at one another; and he that is dependent, bows to him that is above him: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as every one knows, it is in vain to wooe Nature off its Adamantine pillars in thoſe things wherein it is unmove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably fixed; no man prays or ſacrifices to it, there may be no more night or Eclipſes. And as vain it is to purifie our ſelves before a Fortune, or recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile our ſelves to that which is ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with it ſelf and us, that it can do us no favours; and ſo ſlippery, that it is impoſſible any ſagacity or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry ſhould be before-hand with it.</p>
            <p>Although then ſome ſuperſtitious Rites have been done to both theſe; yet a certain underſtanding and will governing muſt have been conceived under them; or we muſt ſay of all Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions they were the moſt ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious, that is the moſt unreaſonable; ſo that, beſides the main Poſition, thoſe Doctrines of Humiliation before God, Repentance and Reformation (which are ſo great a part of Scripture) fall to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59784:33"/> the ground alſo, and with them the reſults of ſound Reaſon and Morality, that tend the ſame way, though by a much dimmer and more wavering light, then the Word of God gives, which is moſt diſtinct and poſitive in this; firſt, That all the inſtruments of puniſhment, with their efficacies and Periods, are found and determined by the Lord himſelf: And then, that what he does therein, is with greateſt counſel and equity; the ends of which are, ſo far as concerns us, made known to us, that by returns to God, according to thoſe ends, we may procure the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of the evils themſelves: which is a clear account in reaſon, why we ſhould wait upon God in the way of his Judgments.</p>
            <p>Againſt this (which we ſay is a clear account in reaſon) no ſuſpicions of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Will or unmoveable Decrees in God, can take place; as if by their unchangeableneſs, they ſhut up theſe undertakings of man within the like inconveniences as the former.</p>
            <p>For thoſe that acknowledge the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of a Divine underſtanding, will
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59784:33"/> eaſily believe, it can draw a thred ſo fine and even between it ſelf and mans Soul, that acts of higheſt reaſon and duty towards himſelf, ſhould have all their incouragements, and yet himſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt ſhadow of turning; and if we cannot find this out to perfection, what wonder is it? That were not an infinite underſtanding, whoſe contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances are all fathomable by a finite; yet let a man appeal to himſelf, and feel how conſiſtently theſe things work within him, and his own experience ſhall be the witneſs hereof. For that Medium, in which theſe acts of man are to move, is made like the water or fluid air, ſoft and yielding, that it gives way, yet without loſing its place, or abating from it ſelf. Every thing hath its own play in it; yet the Laws of it are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere and unchangeable. It is ſwathed with an eternal ordination upon it, and yet allows every thing its own liberty; not like the compacted rock, that yields to no encounter, without dreadful vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; but as the eaſie ſtream that is willing to comply, and is ſtill under as conſtant a conſtitution as any other part
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59784:34"/> of Nature, under him who ſends up by the Hills, and down by the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys, theſe waters unto the place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for them; which do even per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade their way through the firm Mountains, that they may obey that Law that is upon them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his taxing or deſcribing the world, had its native progreſs in the pliant current of that determination, that Chriſt ſhould be born in <hi>Bethlehem;</hi> and the prediction, it ſhould be ſo, inſinuated it ſelf and its completion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the heart of a Prince, affecting a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon his own Dominion; to which that heart was as penetrable as one ſtream of air, or rivulet of water to another; though often as the heart of Leviathan congealed with it ſelf, ſo are the reſolves and inclinations of maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick breaſts. From whence we ſee, how poſſible the conceptions of our returns to God, finding their place in his moſt eſtabliſhed Ordinations are; and how poſſible alſo are his Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our good, making their way through our returns to himſelf, while they mutually paſs and repaſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59784:34"/> without any infringement of one another.</p>
            <p>That Decree of Gods to accept Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents to mercy, is of the ſame date with any other of his diſpoſes: as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they never claſhed in that aevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Source of all things; no more do they in their derivation from him upon time.</p>
            <p>The difference is then infinite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt having to do with God, the moſt perfect mind and will, who ſees into every thing, ballances one thing with another, and ſo compoſes time and Eternity, and draws them into Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelliſms; that how ancient ſoever his Counſels are, he doth all he doth with as preſent an attemperation, as if he had never reſolved of them before, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered only their juſt now condition. Thus he pardons, as if his pardoning mercy were of the ſame date with our humiliation, and his compaſſion then inclined, when our repentance ſues it: For his eternal purpoſes of Grace ſlide down to us with their own efficacy, and invite our Souls to thoſe motions in which he delights; veſting themſelves
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59784:35"/> firſt in our acts of duty towards him, and then crowning themſelves in thoſe acts with remiſſion and removal of evil: ſo far are Divine determinations from putting thoſe bars upon mans Soul, and its worthieſt endeavours, that muſt needs be put upon them by thoſe that ſet a dark Fate or Chance in the place of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. All reaſons that affirm God and his Providence, combine in this; That all our calamities are the Judgments of God. How cloſe God and his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence are united, may appear to us by thoſe diſcourſes which are written to that very purpoſe, and would be here a digreſſion too great to inſiſt upon. But in the general, we may accommode the aſſertions of it to the minds of men, with this conſideration; How cloſe is Providence to an infinite Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, immenſe Power, unlimited efficacy, and preſence. The narrow Souls of men entertain things one after another, and deſire the firſt to withdraw, when they would be free with thoſe that come after; or if we endeavour to converſe with them together, we find a
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59784:35"/> crowd and throng, which always begets tumult and confuſion; ſo that many things cannot ſo much as lodge with us but with ſtraitneſs and difficulty, and in danger to thruſt out one another.</p>
            <p>But with an Almighty mind, infinite alſo, every thing hath its own full room, and conſideration, timely diſpatch with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cumber or aggravation to it.</p>
            <p>As the eye of him that is upon a Tower, commands a multitude below with greateſt eaſe and quiet of obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; ſo infinitely more doth the eye of Providence ſurvey every thing, and is yet out of the duſt of them.</p>
            <p>We who are confined to a certain place, do with much pain and motion viſit thoſe things that require our care and ſuperintendence, according to the diſtance they are in from us: But omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſence needs no removes of it ſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much larger then its affairs, and the wing of its protection more ſpacious then the Creatures that are to come under it. Our little greatneſs loſes its reputation, which is moſt of it ſelf, by dealing with little things. But the highneſs of God, without any degrade,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59784:36"/> condeſcends to every Atome, as the Sun with its light, and yet removes not out of its Sphere, nor takes off its beams from greater things.</p>
            <p>This ſummary meditation may ſhew us how eaſie Providence is to God. The unſeparableneſs of it from him, is no leſs to be concluded by laying them thus together; he that is thus infinitely preſent with an increate, and therefore ſupreme underſtanding, always in Act, muſt induſtriouſly affect improvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; which ſo great a goodneſs can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not (were it poſſible) or elſe he doth eternally provide. Further, we thus argue:</p>
            <p>That the Fabrick of the world ſhould derive it ſelf from any but the ſpring of Being, is to deny that there is ſuch a one: when it is in Being, that it ſhould depend upon any but God himſelf, who is this Fountain of Eſſence, were to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute another into his Glory, which he tells us he will not give to any: but that he ſhould at firſt create, and ſtill ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port things without any conſideration or reaſons worthy his wiſdom or praiſe; or that he ſhould truſt them to run on
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59784:36"/> themſelves to thoſe ends, is unbecoming the Sovereign underſtanding and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. That he ſhould maintain the world to be the ſtage of ungoverned incertainty, is ſo unlike the true appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of God, that we can no ſooner ſettle in the acknowledgment, that the whole Frame of Nature is his, and that it runs its courſe in his hand; but we muſt conclude, he is aware of all things that paſs in his own world, and does not leave it as a field for things to take their chance in; but interpoſes himſelf to ſteer them to ſome certain Haven, wherein his own glory and the due end of things will be found together. There muſt therefore be a Providence. But that there ſhould be a Providence, and Judgments not from God, is moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible: For if we ſhould allow things of a minute nature to ſlip this eye (which we can by no means do) yet to grant ſo great mutations, ſuch huge diſlocations as are in Judgments, and that they ſhould come to paſs, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence being either not awake to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider them, or that the cauſes of them ſhould never ask the conſent of it; were
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59784:37"/> to confeſs the word, but withdraw the thing; for there were nothing left, but a bare ſpectatorſhip.</p>
            <p>If we ſuppoſe ſome malignant Spirits ſo violent upon the unhappineſs of the world, as the Prince of them was upon <hi>Jobs</hi> deſtruction, and that they are not to be controlled by this higher ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we make it the ſame thing, as if there were no Providence; for that is none in this caſe, that is not Almighty.</p>
            <p>If there was a neceſſary connexion of things from the beginning, and there needs no after-conſideration; yet if Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence did not, what put them ſo toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? and where was it; when they were joynted into one another? And why were they fixed upon ſuch points of time? If any ſhould anſwer, they muſt fall ſomewhere, and it ſo fell out they ſhould be placed as they are: It follows then, there was no room for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, nor indeed for the diſpoſes of a rational will, but Fate and Chance took all out of the hand of God and infinite wiſdom, which who, together with a Providence, can believe? If then there be a God, there muſt be a Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59784:37"/> and if there be a Providence, all evils are Judgments from God upon men.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We may reaſon this from the ſo ready and immediate ſenſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, not only of particular perſons, but in general. For no ſooner are men arreſted with theſe ſtrokes, but imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately they are apprehenſive of a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme and juſt hand that is upon them; and betake themſelves to thoſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of atoneing it, which are within the compaſs of that Religion they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand. Now though this is aſcribed by the enemies of God and Providence to an unreaſonable fear, that hath been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled into the minds of men by the cunning of thoſe who have for their own ends made uſe of the natural jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies and ſuſpitions man is ſo prone to, through the weakneſs of his condition ſubject to every impreſſion, and mould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them into this ſuperſtition: Yet let it be conſidered, there can be no greater preſumption then thus to diſhonour the univerſal ſenſe of Mankind, and call into doubt what is ſealed by the whole world.</p>
            <pb n="36" facs="tcp:59784:38"/>
            <p> For with as good ſatisfaction may the ſanctions of Morality be unhinged from that awe and regard the minds of men bear to them, as if there were nothing in them, but the preſent uſe they are of: As for any intrinſick goodneſs that ſhould induce their reverence and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, or reaſon for a ſting of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience as an immediate revenge of tranſgreſſion, they muſt be refuſed as meer apparitions raiſed by affrighted reaſon, or conjured up by the Necro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancy of State-policy: And if this be not ſufficient to condemn any ſuppoſition of unreaſonableneſs, what is?</p>
            <p>But what can the Atheiſt relieve by his reſolved opinations againſt a Divine hand in thoſe evils good men ſtyle Judgments? neither able to ſhroud a man from the leaſt of them, or to wrench out of his own mind the ſecret fears of ſome ſuperior power, that guides them againſt the world.</p>
            <p>In point of Judgment, the moſt he can pretend to, is but to arrive at the proof of this; That poſſibly he may be in the right (which indeed he never can to any tolerable acquieſcence) In the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59784:38"/> mean time he leaves both himſelf, and all whom he would perſwade to the force of the other ſide poſſibility, and with this diſadvantage; if that which he would have, be true, it doth no man any conſiderable ſervice to know it, or injury to be ignorant: for it abates no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the main evil, which certainly deals not more mercifully for an Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtick conceit; or is any man condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſuffer an exceſs of puniſhment for not being ſo irreligiouſly learned. But if that be true which he would not have ſo, he robs men of thoſe remedies that are to be uſed for the prevention and remove of Judgments, and deſpoyls them of that peace that comes in with the ſubmiſſion to ſo wiſe and holy a hand, beſides the dangers of increaſing the wrath by not acknowledging God in it. Certainly it is much more chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable to any man that is willing to make an Intereſt in God, or would have true peace, that all thoſe unhappineſſes of the world ſhould be ſo wiſely and juſtly diſpoſed, as we now diſcourſe, then that they ſhould be under no Law, or from no ſuch Divine Counſel; with
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59784:39"/> which to comply, carries ſo great reaſon and advantage.</p>
            <p>He that goes to help himſelf by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving this hand of Government out of the world, doth himſelf no other ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice then this, that he utterly takes away ſuch a thing as a rational peace or patience, other then that upon force; leaving himſelf, firſt to the mercy of the next accident, afterwards under the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to bear what it lays upon him, without ſtirring himſelf under it; but ſubmitting to it, becauſe it cannot be otherwiſe, and only for that reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it cannot be otherwiſe. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, he that owns God in all that comes upon him, hath a large Sphere of ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and pious motion, in contemplation of that righteouſneſs and goodneſs that meet together in the infliction; which obliges him to reſign to them, and out of a ſenſe of them to compoſe himſelf into a more excellent and heavenly ſtate of mind, which abundantly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſes for the indurance. He hath the hopes of an eternal happineſs, though he periſh now; he hath the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a ſeaſonable relief, when the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59784:39"/> ends of ſuch a gracious and wiſe Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline are obtained. There are the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent mitigations of the outward evil, thoſe internal conſolations with which ſo compaſſionate a Father as God tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers his anger.</p>
            <p>Againſt all this the Atheiſt lays in the ballance a ſtupefaction of conſcience and all religious Principles, as the only Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for that ſullen reſolution he ſo much admires and praiſes above that weakneſs of Spirit, brought in (ſaith he) by the unneceſſary fears of a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, which do ſo intimidate and chill the Spirits of men; and that it may be a perfect counterpoiſe, he magnifies this braver freedom, that takes the mind off from the rack and torture of an amazed conſcience. But he conſiders not, that this is a comfort proper for him only that deſires there ſhould be no God, that is altogether indiſpoſed to ſeek him, and uncertain of him, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the aſſurances he is pleaſed to give of himſelf.</p>
            <p>The firſt choice of every man muſt needs be, There ſhould be a God, and he ſhould be his Friend. For who
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59784:40"/> would be without the care and bounty of ſo rich a Being in amity with him? But when a man finds a mutual enmity betwixt God and him, his ſecond choice may be, there ſhould be none; yet when he underſtands him willing to be reconciled upon conditions of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, he will return to his firſt choice, who is not bewitched with the love of his ſins, the renounce of which is ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary a term of his peace. In the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent caſe, a mans firſt election will be, not to be racketted at adventure by evil; but that it ſhould be governed by one ſo holy and merciful as God is: but when he perceives an eternal Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice brought over him by this wiſh, he will deſire to reverſe it, and that any hand rather then ſuch a one ſhould hold him in theſe cords; one, that though it ſports firſt in his miſery, will at laſt conclude him in a death ſenſeleſs of pain. From this deſperate volition, he is laſtly recovered by the grace of the Goſpel, that diſarming all evil of its ſting, allays preſent horrour with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting kindneſs to him that repents and believes. He then only that dares not
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59784:40"/> truſt, and is reſolved not to reform, is the fit Patient for this Phyſitian of no value. But yet alas, theſe things are no mans choice, nor hath he a vote, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſhall be or no. He hath only a moment, in which he can ſeem to give them a Being in his own thoughts, or annihilate them: yet ſtill they are, whether he will or no, even now. He finds them here, he doth not make them, nor can undo them. Mountains are not removed by a breath, nor do dreams of opinion take away ſolid things; but themſelves are diſſolved and preſſed into nothing by them. He is conveyed in a phantaſtick peace to an eternal miſery, that believes there is no God nor Juſtice; and is healed for a minute, at the price of a never ending horrour, that ſhuts his eyes againſt thoſe moſt wholſome Principles. All opinions contrary to which, are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxication of the Soul, and not the true eaſe of it. Laſtly, is ſo much poſſible as this? that a man ſhould baffle his own mind in that, wherein it is of the ſenſe of all the world, by thoſe private opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions which he is always begging of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59784:41"/> himſelf to believe, but cannot prevail, except he have firſt feared himſelf by obduration in ſin: It being much a more expedite Method to deſtroy the ſenſe of an avenging hand that way, then by arguments of reaſon, which cannot but be a friend to truth, though tortured againſt it: Even as the mind conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt a God, is the more ſurpriſed with the ſenſe of one, through the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natenſs of the principle. A ſerious debate lets in more water then can be pumped out, while the wicked man ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing for a God and his diſtributions of Juſtice, unawares loſes his own Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples by unholy practices; ſo that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm ſtands in need of wickedneſs to ſupport it: but let it call to any other, if they will anſwer it; or to which not only of the Saints, but even of the Sages in Morality will it turn?</p>
            <p>Thus the ſpeculative and practick Atheiſt edifie one another: for while the ſpeculative lays the beſt foundation for the practick (ſince nothing can make wickedneſs ſo reaſonable as this confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, There is no God or Juſtice) on the other ſide, the practick gives the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59784:41"/> greateſt credibility to the ſpeculative; for nothing draws the Being of God, or his retributions into greater queſtion, then a bold wicked life. But while they thus uphold each other, they alſo pull down themſelves in one another. For many of thoſe that deny God by their actions, profeſs to abhor the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple that protects them; and many of thoſe that owne the Principle, joyn in condemning much of the practice that grows ſo naturally from it.</p>
            <p>But all this while, true conſcience and ſecret ſenſe in mans Soul, hearkens neither to <hi>Pilate</hi> or <hi>Herod,</hi> when they fall out, or when they agree; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſes oft ſo buſily with its own fears, that the torment of ſuſpicion (as it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently happens) exceeds what the Atheiſt charges upon the full appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion and belief of a God, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more, if taken in with all its ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage: where then is the good of Atheiſm?</p>
            <p n="4">4. The notable circumſtances of Judgments ſo tim'd with ſins, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terparting them, do as plainly declare a Juſtice, as when among men offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59784:42"/> are executed in the very place where their crimes were committed, and with ſuch Characters of their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, that every man may know they were on purpoſe deſigned, that their ſin might be read in their puniſhment. Thus <hi>Adonibezek</hi> acknowledged a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliation in the hand of God upon him; <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> and <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> were taken in the very act of their pride and preſumption againſt God. No leſs are all Hiſtories full of the ſame inſtances; ſo that the Hiſtorians, though ſenſeleſs of God and his Juſtice according to the Scriptures, have pointed to the Divine hand, and taken notice how expreſs it was in marking the ſins of men by his righteous Judgment upon them.</p>
            <p>Theſe are not indeed ſo general, as never to be otherwiſe; but given as Indexes of that Juſtice that is always the ſame, however it appears ſeverally: Even as the Formalities and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies uſed by ſeveral Nations in their puniſhments, make no difference in the main.</p>
            <p>If thereforce the force of this reaſon be avoided, becauſe other acts of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59784:42"/> have no apparent affinity with the ſins puniſhed by them; and it is thence concluded, thoſe that have, are but the flouriſhes of Chance, wherein it coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeits diſcretion, as Nature ſometimes diſſembles Art: let it be thus reinfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. Firſt there is no doubt, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of men lead them to many more inſtances then can be publickly obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; but thoſe that are of open notice, are both ſo many and ſo fair, as to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them that have a reverent ſenſe of God and his Judgments, and to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, even to inexcuſableneſs, the more prophane, attacquing their conſciences, whether they will or no.</p>
            <p>But further it is to be conſidered, God doth not force Religion upon mens minds, but offers them fair inducements and reaſons, that it may be a matter of choice and not of neceſſity; ſo that good men have that hold of the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of it they deſire, and which do abundantly ſettle their minds; and all have that which is ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and therefore to condemn them in their refuſals.</p>
            <p>That which knows its own authority
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59784:43"/> and Truth, ſubmits not it ſelf to the uſe of vulgar importunacy; but offering to every one enough, leaves men to their choice. He that is wiſe, is wiſe for himſelf: but whoſo ſcorneth, he alone ſhall bear it. No man can in the thing it ſelf, either advantage or indamage Religion. Beſides, the ſupreme opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Grace always remain to that moſt bleſſed Spirit, whoſe inſpirations are more free then the wind, and his penetrations more intimate to the Soul then it ſelf; without which even mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles themſelves dazzle without per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading: and how far a man perverſe and obſtinate will withſtand God in his moſt forcible Sieges of Judgment, is moſt evident in <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> It is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then, if thoſe who are not ſo plyed with theſe Arguments, ſay, Who is the Lord?</p>
            <p>God generally carries things upon ſuch a line, that there never want thoſe mirrors wherein he may be ſeen by quick and humble eyes; and yet they are ſo tempered, that prejudications of men, either through luſt, prophaneſs, or vain opinion, ſee him not in the cleareſt of them.</p>
            <pb n="47" facs="tcp:59784:43"/>
            <p> Thoſe things which preſent times are worthily earneſt in aſſerting as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted verities, that they might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the reaſonableneſs of our Religion <hi>(viz.</hi> the miracles done by <hi>Moſes,</hi> Chriſt, and his Apoſtles) were as certain to multitudes of the Age then preſent, as ſenſe could make them, and yet not enough to perſwade. The little Fragments of Hiſtory we ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully gather up from thoſe Heathens that writ ſynchronically with the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts, to give evidence by to ſome matters of Fact, were unneceſſary to them who had broad light to diſcover the whole ſeries of things, and yet were unconverted; which ſhews Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is carried in a ſtream of Grace and Divine Illumination, wafting the Soul that is meek, and him that feareth God, into the ſecret of his Covenant; while theſe outward manifeſtations are ſit Channels for it to run in, though they convey nothing effectually to unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared Souls.</p>
            <p>It is not then neceſſary, there ſhould be juſt ſuch a meaſure of this kind of palpable aſſurance an Atheiſtick Wit
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59784:44"/> demands; nor would it do with him, who is not perſwaded by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, that is by ſuch an aſſurance of the evidence of things, as God in Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Goodneſs metes out to men, giving ſtill more and more to him that ſoberly improves; but taking from him who repines at the littleneſs of what he hath, and neglects it, even that which he hath.</p>

            <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>A Solution offered to the ſeveral Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions againſt this Poſition, That Judgments are from God.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT is an obſervation of old, a little knowledge of Nature makes men ſwollen with ſudden conceit, Atheiſts; but a deep and accurate inſight into things, ſurpriſes them with the clearneſs and evidence of a Deity. Men having plaid a while upon the ſurface of things, and leaping off from them, conclude haſtily againſt a Providence, while thoſe that are patient, and leiſurely conſider, ſee even greateſt reaſon for it, there
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59784:44"/> where Triflers pitch againſt it: Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious minds that will not obey the truth, nor can be quiet in any of the ſageſt Principles, faſten in the ſofteſt places, that give ſome little entrance to bold cavil; but they that ſearch deeper, find ſolid Rock there.</p>
            <p>Wits that think themſelves never high enough, except they are advanced upon the ruines of all ſound Maximes, and have that under their feet, which others wear as a Crown upon their heads, diſpute againſt them, till they are thrown off with ſcorn and ſhame by the evidence of unmoveable truth and certainty, that cannot be unfixed by a breath; but though theſe winds and waves beat, yet the houſe they conceit fallen, ſtands, and great is the ſtanding of it; while they themſelves are waſted into nothing, but a bluſter of vanity, and the foam of their own ſhame, and at length hurried by the Whirlwind into utter darkneſs.</p>
            <p>But let us weigh the objections of greateſt confidence againſt our affer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods Primacy in Judgments.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>1</label> The evils we call Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,

               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> It cannot be denyed, but that Judgments are, and may be traced up to their natural cauſes; as Peſtilences to the corruption of Air, inequality of Seaſons; Famines to exceſſive ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Moiſture or Drought, or other apparent reaſons; Wars to ambition of Princes, diſſoluteneſs of Governments, populouſneſs of Nations forced to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant themſelves, with innumerable the like, which ſeem to obſcure God and his higheſt Ordination. But how far is this upon a ſerious debate from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenching it in the leaſt? Are not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral cauſes ſet on work in the terribleſt executions among men? and yet no one is ſo ſenſeleſs as to queſtion whether they are puniſhments, or things did ſo conſpire? As well when a <hi>Ravailliac</hi> dyes in the Tormentors hand, may it be ſuppoſed there was no Juſtice intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but Nature fell in upon him. Or how doth this leſſen God more then earthly Princes?</p>
            <p>Nay indeed it exalts God, that he ſits in his Chair, and yet orders all
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59784:45"/> things. Nature goes on in its own courſe, the wills of men move in their proper freedom, and contingencies ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver up and down in their fluid air, and all bring about his juſteſt ends, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with them his righteous determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt ſinners. Is not God much the greater, that things come to paſs ſtilly, and without noiſe of miracle, that he comes not in this ſenſe out of his place, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſetled ſtate of things, every time he puniſhes; and yet when he pleaſes to puniſh with a Divine gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, miracles of vengeance are alike eaſie to him?</p>
            <p>Some things go ſlowly on, and at length come to thoſe points, where they determine in unhappineſs to man. Theſe finiſhing their courſe, and treading their circles within ſuch a time, or near it, are by obſervation deprehended in their motion, and expected, yea almoſt known like the ſtages of the heavenly bodies. As Contagions have been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to make their return within ſuch a term; under no very unlike calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion have fallen the peace of Nations, the periods of Empires; though to ſome
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59784:46"/> of theſe are allowed Ages for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution; as among the Stars there be ſome ſaid to claim no leſs; others ſtart ſuddenly out of the boſom of their hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den cauſes, and fall with an unſuſpected violence upon mankind; but both are alike under the cogniſance of God, and ſubject to his jurisdiction. Known to God are all his works from the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world, and the whole plot of things, with all their interferings, lye before him; even the planetary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of mens wills are deſcryed of old.</p>
            <p>The things that riſe up ſucceſſively to us, are one moment to him. It is no wonder then, that Judgments ſhould fall perpendicularly upon ſins, though they move never ſo punctually in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures path. For the one <hi>(viz.</hi> ſin) ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe never ſo naked a permiſſion of it; yet it muſt be fore-ſeen, becauſe of that permiſſion: for all that God permits, he hath decreed from all Eternity to permit. The other <hi>(viz.</hi> his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) are not only fore-ſeen, but or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered upon ſuch ſins fore-ſeen; how exact then may the placing of the one
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59784:46"/> be with the other; and to him that calleth things that are not, as if they were, be a perfect act of Judgment? And to us who ſee things, not in the ſhell of thoſe elderly cauſes we now diſcourſe of, but take notice of them only as they are hatched into execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they firſt appear as extemporary ſentences of Judgment upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent occaſion: But obſerving more nearly, and being more ſagacious about them, we find the evils that preſs us have a ſetled progreſs, and were fixed upon ſome cauſes, that being further off to us, were not ſo ſoon eſpied; but that the evils we commit, are, after all our examination, found to be of a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and accidental kind of birth and growth, of a much latter edition to the Judgments we thought ordered againſt them, which were on their way, though at a great diſtance before the ſins were committed: and therefore we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, they cannot be Judgments, ſeeing it is unreaſonable, puniſhments ſhould be preparing for an offence not yet done; but they only happened to meet together: for if ſuch ſins, as we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59784:47"/> they came to revenge, had never been committed; yet theſe effects be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing riſen already, and ſprung from their principles, would have come to their ends. But helped by a ſounder reaſon, inlightned by the Word of God, we find the ſins were as early in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of God, though his infinite purity can be no way the Author of them, as the progreſſes of Nature, which come directly out of his hand.</p>
            <p>Further we might add, if this were not full, Sins are ſo always in motion, that it is no injuſtice preparations of puniſhment ſhould be ſo too; and how far Nature may be haſtned, or retarded to ſerve God, is very unknown to us, who are admitted at the moſt but to the Anti-rooms of Providence, but kept off from the preſence; and may look into the outer Ware-houſes of Nature, but are ſecluded from the Shop and retired Work-houſes, where things are ſet forward and backward without our privity.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Judgments, the executions of which the wills of men are ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to, are of the ſame, and in this
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:59784:47"/> laſt particular of a clearer account. For whether they are thoſe that require a tract of time to accompliſh them, as the leiſurely diſſolution of States through daily degeneracy of manners, opening the way, and inviting forreign violen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or breeding inteſtine diſſentions, where the ſin and the puniſhment grow in wreaths and links one with another (for all wickedneſs carries weakneſs of counſel along with it, and is in tendency to ruine) or whether they are ſudden ſtorms, that through ſome unexpected accident roſe up; yet they that allot God the ſtraiteſt Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over the wills of men, and tye up his Prerogative cloſeſt, will allow him to call for a ravenous bird out of the Eaſt, and to hiſs for the flye beyond the River; that is, he can ſummon on the ſudden, or with more leiſure diſpoſe the minds of men to ſuch actions, that while their own projects are all they feel or know of, yet his juſt wrath upon thoſe againſt whom they come, lies ſecretly hid, and unknown to them paſſes on with them; and though they think themſelves excited only by
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:59784:48"/> themſelves, and the conſiderations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them; yet there is a ſpring out of their reach, and deeper then their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom.</p>

            <p>And therefore it is worthy inquiry, how it comes to be an adverſary to it ſelf; for it would have minded in all things the perfection of it ſelf, in the whole, and every particular, if there had not been a feud raiſed by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it, in revenge of ſin, and enmity infuſed into one thing againſt another.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:59784:48"/> It will be hard to give any account of theſe deſtructive acts of Nature, ſo eaſie to our thoughts as this of God diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with ſins, and puniſhing tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors by them.</p>

            <p>Ignorant people afford a blindfold compaſſion to all they find in the hand of humane Juſtice; and thoſe that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear wiſer, are touched with the ſame weakneſs, if their crimes are not as plain as they would have them, not conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe reaſons Juſtice and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment together inforce upon the powers that have ſo adjudged them; and are therefore bold to reproach them with want of righteouſneſs and mercy: great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er folly and preſumption do they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray, who impeach him whoſe good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and mercy being equal with his ſtrength and Soveraignty, are all infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite; yet not to be meaſured by Rules proper to finity, even as his Eternity can be comprehended by no ſtandards of time, to whom a thouſand years, of ſo great account with us, are but as one day; and laſtly, that light he dwells in ſo inacceſſible, that ſearching all things it oppreſſes audacious inquiries into it ſelf.

Nor is it unequal to that Age upon which the blow falls, ſeeing latter times make one body with thoſe that went before; Monarchies with the Proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors and Poſterity are united in their conſideration, as the parts with the whole: why then ſhould it be ſtrange, that God ſhould order the guilt and puniſhment of elder Ages to glide down
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59784:53"/> upon the deſcendents of them, as well as thoſe advantages of wealth and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, purchaſed at that very rate by their Anceſtors, that the inheritance of all ſhould be conveyed together? Nor is it hard, when the meaſure of a Nations ſin is as one common veſſel, which they that go before, with them that come after, have filled together, and it grows full, that the unhappy ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration that crowns it, ſhould receive the Antiſtoichon or countermeaſure of Judgments; which Doom yet is by a juſt interpretation placed upon the whole, and in ordinary diſcourſe refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to it; for who ſeeing poſterity mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, doth not call to mind the ſins of Forefathers, ſo far as they know them, &amp; acknowledge them puniſhed in their Childrens ruine? And if the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were not in this manner, there muſt be a quite different ſtate of the world. All which will be clearer, when we come to the variety God uſes in admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring Judgments.</p>

               </label> Beſides what we have already ſaid to clear this, and ſhall hereafter be ſpoken; the replication we chuſe at this time, ſhall conſiſt in theſe following Particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The terrour that ſpreads it ſelf univerſally, while Judgments are exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting, is no inconſiderable degree of a Judgment, even upon thoſe that are not yet ſtruck. For if every death makes ſome impreſſion upon the ſpectators, though in health, becauſe they carry the ſame mortality about them; much more when deaths are linked, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger flies every way, like chain-ſhot,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59784:54"/> cutting off many together. They that are conſcious to themſelves of the ſame capacities of evil, tremble every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and their life hangs in doubt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them; which God himſelf ranks among the ſoreſt of afflictions upon men.</p>
            <p>Thus God communicates his wrath, and ſtrikes more then thoſe upon whom his hand comes: The very report and ſound of their ſtroke and fall, being a vexation and puniſhment upon others. The paſſing of the grounded ſtaff raiſes a general out-cry and lamentation: For though ſome are ſo ſecure, as to be touched only in themſelves, for whom ſome worſe thing is provided; yet doth not their more then uſual obduracy take off from the force of this conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, any more then particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions invalidate a general Rule. The Thunderbolt that falls but in one place, aſtoniſhes and ſhakes round about with the terrour, violent motion, and roar of it; from whence they that in ſuch evils ſeem moſt ſecure, are but upon their parol, and daily compounding for their ſafety, put upon often flights and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:59784:54"/> continual fears; which are at leaſt great drops of that ſhower, which comes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in more abundance upon ſome, but leſſens every ones impunity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Tis incredible how great the circulation of Judgments is; thoſe which begin at the feet, or meaner parts of a Nation, inſenſibly climb up to the head; there being unknown Sympathies in the civil, as well as natural body. God therefore threatens a whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with thoſe evils that fall eſpecially upon ſome parts; when he wounds in the head, it is generally fatal to the whole; when he looſes the girdle of Princes, and takes away Counſellors, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is ruined; when he ſtrikes in the lower parts, yet it is reciprocated by Principalities and Powers, as <hi>David</hi> felt the ſtroke of that deſtroying Angel that directed it ſelf upon the people: God therefore uſes a viciſſitude, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times taking one, ſometimes another, when yet he minds the affliction of all; for he that can diſperſe his puniſhments by making one the fountain of them to the reſt, is not at all liable to ſuſpitions of partiality, any more then that Juſtice
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59784:55"/> accuſed as lame, that paſſes upon one member of a man, and yet intends the whole man.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Very often the Judgments of God are ſweeping, and in the Prophets phraſe, cut off root and branch, and ſo deprive of all poſſible ſcruple; of which there are ſo many dreadful monuments, as to make this a very feeble cavil of thoſe who mind not ſo much the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of their reaſon, as they delight in a ſlavery to their own Hypotheſis. But as God ſometimes reſolved to take away the uſe of ſome prophane Proverbs, and ſcandalous to his truth or goodneſs, by the ſeverity and preſentaneouſneſs of his Judgments; ſo doth he often by the ſame means ſilence many of the objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made againſt his ſupreme hand in them: yet a fuller anſwer of this turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to every ſide of it, is ſtill intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>4</label> Many of thoſe Fatalities we call Judgments, are but neceſſary methods for the continuation of the world in that ſucceſſion, wherein it is now ſetled. It muſt be ſo, one genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion goeth, that another may come; it
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59784:55"/> is no more then the ſowing of the ſeed, that firſt dyes, that it may riſe in the greater flouriſh: And at ſome times more haſte muſt be made, then by the leiſure of ordinary dying, that ſupernu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meraries may be disburdened, who would elſe increaſe too great a charge upon the Earth.</p>

               </label> If we take it for granted, that daily mortality (which we enter not into the account of Judgments) will not take off the too great burden of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinds increaſe, and make that room in the world ſo neceſſary for ſucceſſion; and that therefore none of the vital blood and ſpirits of a Nation are let out in great mortalities and ſlaughters, to weaken and impair it; but that they give advantage to the ſurviving part: yet it will not come home to the obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors purpoſe. For whatever we ſet in the throne of things, Nature, or but Chance, that it ſhould do ſo much well, and either not have contrived a ſweeter tranſlation of things, or as luckily, as in other things, have happened upon it, is enough to give an overthrow to this whole ſuppoſition. But to us that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59784:56"/> and humbly adore God, it cannot be thought that he ſhould go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, and bring to paſs ends with the grief and unhappineſs of his innocent Creatures, who could with the ſame eaſe to his Divine power and wiſdom, and more agreeable to that goodneſs, have adminiſtred them with all the mildneſs and clemency in which that richeſt Being delights it ſelf. But things carried ſo different hereunto, argue as high as may be, the ſenſe of a Judgment: That God ſhould make room in the world by the hurries of men out of it, which might have been as well by a gentler tranſplantation: that he ſhould change ſeaſons by the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of ſtorms and tempeſts, and ſhew the wonderful events of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence by flaſhes of Lightning, and Blazing-ſtars, which would have been as clearly underſtood by the kinder beams of his goodneſs, aſſures us he is neceſſitated by his righteouſneſs and juſtice to tranſact by ways ſtrange to him, and in which he hath no pleaſure; and therefore puts them into ſuch a frame, that they may at once diſcover
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:59784:56"/> his Attributes and Counſels with that wrath and ſeverity that have their only diſplay upon the ſins of men. Thus the iniquity of the <hi>Amorites</hi> fall moved God by ſo dreadful a diſplacing of them to give the inheritance to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his Bounty to one fell in with his Juſtice upon the other; the former of which, infinite underſtanding could have carried in another Channel, had there not been righteous reaſons for the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter alſo. The Jews infidelity intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the Adoption of the Gentiles upon their own rejection; which yet was ſo little neceſſary otherwiſe, that their reconciliation will be as life from the dead.</p>

            <p>BEcauſe the wrath of God in his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciary Acts, is, as we have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, ſo often diſcovered in the irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar moves of Nature, which is guided
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:59784:57"/> by an intelligence extern to it ſelf, and ſo can commit no offence; and this intelligence is no lower then that which created it; ſo that no errour can be charged upon Creatures, with which nothing was ſupremely intruſted, but muſt be aſcribed to God originally: It may add much to the clearneſs of what hath been ſo earneſtly aſſerted of his hand in all the evils that are in the world, to diſcourſe the reaſonableneſs of his adminiſtration, when he unra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels in diſpleaſure that order of the Creation he hath with ſo wiſe and skilfull a hand compoſed, and interrupts the chain of things himſelf hath inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven, upon occaſion of the ſins of men, leſt it ſhould ſeem diſhonourable to his goodneſs and unchangeable coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, if he chuſes ſo; or derogatory to his wiſdom &amp; power, if he is ſo neceſſitated. For whenever ſinful diſorders provoke him to diſanul or confuſe thoſe things wherein he hath ſhewed himſelf ſo wiſe, ſomething ſuitable befals his works, to that <hi>Solomon</hi> complains of as one of the greateſt grievances of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature in its acqueſts, and that
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:59784:57"/> made him go about to deſpair of all his labour, <hi>viz.</hi> That a fooliſh Son ariſes and diſſipates that ſtate of things the wiſdom of his Father tranſmitted to him with beauty and ſplendour. To the reſolution of this, will be moſt condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the looſing of the doubts that ariſe from the conſtant weakneſs, debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and incompleteneſs of things to their ends, their frequent aberrations, and miſcarriages from them; which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagiouſly ſolved, will contribute much light to this caſe of Judgments.</p>
            <p>Let us then ſearch the original order of the world, and ſee how fairly the diſorder of it, either general, or more extraordinary in time of Judgments, agrees with the goodneſs and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, and is reconciled with the glory of the firſt Creation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When things were in their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mordial ſtate, ſet into ſuch a poſture, that at the ſame time they expreſſed the bounty and wiſdom of the Creator, and their amity one with another; man ſtood at the head of them, in whoſe happineſs they conſpired, and paid him their ſeveral tributes, as to a native
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59784:58"/> Prince: They rejoyced in his Glory and Grandeur, receiving from him the honour of a near alliance, and bowed to him with humbleſt obedience, as fit to command them, through the excellency of a high-born ſpirit. They all in their ſeveral degrees of Being were diſpoſed, as one common ear, to take the ſound of mans contentment, which rebounded from Heaven to Earth; and the Eccho ſo conveyed, that it took hold of both ends of the Creation at once. The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens hearing the Earth, the Earth the Corn and Wine, and all, Man. The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens ſend him down their ſweeteſt and kindeſt influences; The Earth breathed nothing upon him but innocent; The Clouds moſt liberal of their fruitfulleſt diſtillations, and the Earth an open bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of its own riches to this lower An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, who being a Spirit placed in a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, hath the opportunity of taſting the pleaſures ariſing from them. Thus all things were created with an aſpect upon man, and for his ſake ordered into their ſeveral claſſes, and prepared to their various motions; wherein we cannot indeed but cry out, What is man that
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:59784:58"/> thou art mindful of him? But who could challenge God for it, whoſe counſels and influences are all his own, and all the whole imaginary ſpace out of him, Nothing? What then could implead God out of its nothing, for doing what he pleaſes with his own? Man being thus the center wherein the Sovereign good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, and the ſervice of all things met (for in him their ſeries and happy order ended) his obedience to God was made the ſecurity of his condition, wherein was intruſted his own welfare and the bleſſing of the whole Creation. For while all things were ſo fixed, that they could chuſe no other ſtate then their own, man having the ſum of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will in himſelf, to uſe it for the good of himſelf and all the Creatures under him, by continuing in his duty to God (the knot wherein all was infolded) what wonder is it, if when he by tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion loſt his own ſtation, for whoſe advantage all things ſtood in their firſt and moſt beautiful order; they alſo run out of their ranks, and joyn in the confuſion he is to be puniſhed by? For they run not with ſuch an exorbitancy,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:59784:59"/> but that they pay as great an honour to the wiſdom of God, united with his Juſtice, as they firſt did to the ſame wiſdom in conjunction with goodneſs, and that ſervice to his indignation, that they had done to his bounty. For which reaſon the effect of this alſo points juſt upon man. For what Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath ſo quick a ſenſe of, and pain in the diſorder as he? or upon whom doth the malignancy fall equally as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, to whoſe ruine the world it ſelf, had without further patience run, had not the Grace of God, intending a reſtauration to that fallen Nature, ſtaid the precipitation? Hence things are kept ſo near the rule and tune to which they were at firſt ſet, that there remain fair prints of their former exactneſs in themſelves, and humble amicableneſs to man, together with the admonitions of his lapſed ſtate; which are ſo inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled, that they give luſter to each other: but ſo ſtill, that they are at a minutes warning, and in a moment take a Divine Allarm to riſe up againſt ſinful man, with the executions of his wrath, in what degrees he pleaſes (even to the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:59784:59"/> turning themſelves into a general flame at laſt, to which they are reſerved by him) and whereunto they were at firſt upon ſuppoſition of ſin equally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared.</p>
            <p>Now in all this, there is as auguſt a preſence of wiſdom, and as great an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding in the diſplays of it ſelf, though ſevere to man in his diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; as great a beauty and order of Juſtice, as there was of Mercy. The night hath its Graces, though in black ſhades, and the glories that inlighten it. There is an order in ſtorms, and a rule in the bloody battles; a declaration of God in Judgments, as well as in acts of bounty.</p>
            <p>Nor is it any change in God, but an even counſel, that in his favour is life and peace; but rebellion againſt him is purſued with diſappointment and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: And what can be more natural then that Nature it ſelf ſhould leave its own place, to ſerve the Creator that fixed it there, or turn out of its way, when the more primitive paths of it lead not to his ends? Or what more unnatural, then that the Lord of all
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:59784:60"/> ſhould be diſſerved? Or what more orderly way of puniſhment, then that thoſe Creatures ſhould riſe up againſt man, that were made for his ſervice, when he ſinned againſt the common So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign of him and themſelves? and that ſinning, he ſhould find his unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs juſt in that place, where his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in his obedience reſted?</p>
            <p n="2">2. This outward world or ſtate of things was tuned to an inward, more excellent and immaterial world, conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted of Holineſs and Righteouſneſs, ſtanding in communion with God, and conformity to him: The perfection and higheſt glory of it was indeed in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the center of it Eternity, where God and bleſſed Spirits under him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habite. But it pleaſed infinite goodneſs to give an example of it alſo in a viſible and material world, and to ſet it floating in time, that after an experiment made, he might again unite it to himſelf in Eternity.</p>
            <p>The great exactneſs, curious frame, and order of the outward world, was a tranſparency for that unſpotted purity from above to ſhine through. The eye
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:59784:60"/> prepared to read the Laws, and behold the Divine Beauty, and in whom the intellectual image it ſelf reſided, was man; who therefore is created ſimilar to it; a Soul inriched with knowledg, righteouſneſs, and true holineſs, ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling through an innocent, inoffenſive, and unſpotted body, that while with his mind he adores that ſupreme and origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal goodneſs, and conforms to it with greateſt pleaſure; he may withal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfully contemplate that wiſdom and righteouſneſs as it were incarnate in the ſeveral Creatures, and viſible in their beauty, order, and peace, wherein they ſtand united one to another.</p>
            <p>This Divine likeneſs in which man himſelf was made, was the life, and all below him a beautiful ſhadow, which received its continuance and livelineſs from the purity, and flouriſh of that heavenly life preſerved in him. By ſin he quenches this Divine ſpark, ſinks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low himſelf, and betrays the whole ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the Creation depending up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. Thus great perſonages held up by the grace of the Prince, ſhining upon their loyalty, ſpread their beams, not
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:59784:61"/> only upon their real dependents, but give honour to their effigies: But fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by treaſon, all the marks of honour they derived, are defaced, and their very repreſentations, though inſenſible, partake their guilt and degradation. Man depoſed from that excellency of Gods image, a cloud covers all about him; the order and peace are diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and flye in pieces, and the whole becomes a black ſhade, in which his ſin and fall are drawn: That Soul that firſt ſhone through, is now impriſoned in its own body, and looking out at the grates, ſees the dreadful likeneſs of its impurity: The body (and Soul by it) feels thoſe pains and diſorders that ariſe firſt through the jars and violences of things intumult and conflict with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ruſhing upon it; then through the want of that ſupply and ſervice, cauſed by the interruption and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the line of things that run up to man. Theſe are alſo daily brought within, in thoſe ſtrifes that fall out among the humours, the continual tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidations of a healthful ſtate, conſtant propenſities, and at laſt putrefaction in
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:59784:61"/> death. All which are a ſenſible hiſtory of ſin and Apoſtacy from God, unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to him, and diſintereſt in him; as the former was of holineſs and a ſtate of favour. Thus falls the glory of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward world in the ruine of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that was the Spirit and Soul of it. In all which there is nothing unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the ſtability or fore-ſight of that Counſel, that firſt contrived things. For when the integrity and perfection of the image of God in man was broken, and all other beauty, but an enſample of it, as it ſtood in him; why ſhould the tranſcription be kept fair, as an honour to him, who had unworthily betrayed the Original? But even according to the firſt deſign, the deformity ruſhing in with the firſt treaſon, was to be drawn upon the very ſame tables that were thus embelliſhed in reſemblance of, and as a dignity to humane Nature; or ſeeing the glory of the Creation was a reflection from the Eternal light, that firſt deſcending upon man with ſtrongeſt rays, was from him with a fainter ſplendour to rebound upon the lower region of the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:59784:62"/> Creatures; when theſe rays were ſo withdrawn, that his day was turned into night, it muſt needs be dark with them alſo. Laſtly, how could the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of man be more equally laid, then in the confuſing thoſe things, the order of which was prepared for his glory, and as an act of Grace to him, and wherein his pleaſure and fruition, as a Creature of this world, conſiſted; when he himſelf was ſo unlovely, and inſtead of a delight, grown an object of repentance to God?</p>
            <p>But everlaſting brightneſs that dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon man in a Mediator, ere it ſet in a total privation, continued much of the primaeve glory to all things as to their fundamental ſtate; yet the cloudy condition of mankind between his own fall and recovery by Chriſt, is exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the waving motion of all the creatures about him, while the conſtant pravity of his Nature is counterparted by as ſetled a vanity and vexation of ſpirit; and the more prodigious diſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of common Nature, are the chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters and deſcriptions of greater viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of theſe Laws of righteouſneſs anew inſtamped upon man.</p>
            <pb n="83" facs="tcp:59784:62"/>
            <p> For God having a greater regard to this inward world, the world ſpiritual, whereof we eſpecially ſpeak; he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts the things we are amazed at, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, in compariſon of thoſe more mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous, our ſins, which are hideouſeſt convulſions, more portentous then Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets and Earthquakes. If then one Iota or tittle of the Law be of a more awful eſtabliſhment then Heaven and Earth, what ſtrange thing is it, if in its revenge we ſee Nature looſe it ſelf, if we hear of Nations and Kingdoms torn up, and diſperſed? For all order of Nature and peace of Nations, being but a caſe of theſe more material things; it is no wonder they are made nothing of, when what they are ſervants to is periſhed and loſt. But that God intends all viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſenſible compoſure of things ſhould wait upon the condition of the ſpiritual and inviſible, is yet more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, in that the final reſolution of all things produces the perfection of the leſs by the greater; when righteouſneſs advanced to the height ſhall dwell in new Heavens and a new Earth, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for it, and the ſpirits of juſt men
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:59784:63"/> made perfect inhabit incorruptible and immortal bodies, made like his glorious body: Then wickedneſs having finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it ſelf, ſhall be ſealed up into a lake of unmixed miſery, which is ſo great a remove from God, that as ſin, it was never created by him, or of primitive intention, but a ſecondary ordination againſt ſin that intruded it ſelf upon the works of God.</p>
            <p>From all this that hath been ſaid, appears the uniformity of the ways of God with themſelves, whenever he moſt reverſes thoſe natural ſanctions. For if without any derogation from them, he ſo early admitted upon the firſt conſtitution ſuch an allay of the excellency of it, and ſo many croſs lines of motion to the truly native ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and into ſuch a fixedneſs, that they are now grown natural, from whence death and affliction are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partners with life and comfort, bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancing and poiſing one another; it is leſs of wonder, that upon greater rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions and perſiſtencies in ſin, God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes his Juſtice and wrath a larger ſcope upon this ſecond ſtate, in which
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:59784:63"/> he hath at the leaſt ſhared things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween proſperity and adverſity.</p>
            <p>When men tranſgreſs the Laws, change Ordinances, break the Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant, we may well expect this more fluctuating and precarious ſtate of Nature ſhould with greater freedom be rolled up and down, and removed from it ſelf. And if at laſt that Covenant of day and night, and thoſe Ordinances of Heaven will reſign themſelves, waiting till thoſe greater then they be vindicated, and reſtored to their full authority by an univerſal Judgment; and if all the Creatures are willing to be paſſed through that fire that is to purge evil wholly down into its own draught, they will now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly even ſurrender themſelves to be made uſe of to the ſooner purpoſes of vengeance upon wicked men, as the Creator pleaſes; whereby they have a prefatory redemption from that vanity and corruption wherein they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded, not willingly: for they ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly expect the time of a full deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, and proportionably now they even lift up their heads to that vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:59784:64"/> they find in a partial Judgment.</p>

            </head>
            <p>HAving thus far in general endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſhew the reaſonableneſs of Judgments, upon conſideration of their agreeableneſs with the firſt ſtate of things, as alſo with the ſecond ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in ſuch a poiſe between proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and adverſity, as we find them: let us yet further, and more particularly ſearch thoſe great Principles upon which theſe dreadful ways of God move them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, when the ſcale in which unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and miſery lye, is preſſed down below the equality we now call Nature (though it be not pure and perfect Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) For they will convey us moſt happily into thoſe rules of practice, by which we may either prevent, remove, or ſuffer them with greateſt advantage: A wiſe ſenſe of them will inable a man
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:59784:64"/> to conſpire with the infinite underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that inflicts them, and to accept the puniſhment; by which he changes the nature of it to himſelf, while he votes with God againſt himſelf by the higher part of his Soul, and kiſſes the rod that afflicts him, adoring the righteouſneſs, equity, and faithfulneſs of God in it, as <hi>David:</hi> I know that thy Judgments are right, and that thou in faithfulneſs haſt afflicted me. But he that ſees not why he ſhould be ſo uſed, hath nothing but a patience created of neceſſity to relieve him, if he be not brutiſhly ſenſeleſs, and ſtupidly bears the knocks that fall on him, till he dyes under them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any regard to the mind of him that ſends them: we have therefore thoſe accounts given us by God in his Word, that we may ſuffer as men.</p>
            <p>That higheſt wiſdom and goodneſs, though he treat in greateſt ſeverities with his rational Creatures, yet allows them the honour of being rational; as great perſons, though malefactors, are notwithſtanding arraigned and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned with more honourable ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and have a ſtate in their death;
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:59784:65"/> even meaner perſons in Governments humane, and remote from Tyranny, are not ſmothered and ſtifled in the dark, but by publick procedure reaſoned into their condemnation.</p>
            <p>It is very diſagreeable to a Soveraign Righteouſneſs, whoſe ſtrength loveth Judgment; to that Creator that made man in his own image, to devote him to deſtruction, ſo much as in this world for his pleaſure, or to give him up to any arbitrary ſpirits that would cruſh him, as men do vileſt Creatures under them, for meer ſport, or becauſe they pleaſe to do ſo: ſo little is that conceit to be aſſented to, that makes ſuch conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures.</p>
            <p>Yet is it not contrary to ſound ſenſe, that man loſing God, and himſelf ſo far, that he caſts off all fear of him, and even unſouls and diſpirits himſelf through ignorance and ſenſuality, ſhould be given up as the prey and ſpoil of thoſe inviſible powers, that being fallen from God, and become ignoble and degenerate, are uſed by him in ſuch black miniſteries, and make uſe (through that Divine permiſſion) ſometimes of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:59784:65"/> one inſtrument, ſometimes of another for their cruelty. Such men are ſunk, as it were too low, for the more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable chaſtiſements of God himſelf, or thoſe bleſſed Spirits who ſerve him in his Judgments only out of zeal to his glory, never out of envy, or in compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to mankind.</p>
            <p>Thus ſome ſort of profligate Rebels, who are not worthy of a ſerious Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice or noble purſuit, are by juſt and wiſe States deſerted to be hunted, like beaſts, by any that will, either for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation or advantage; who are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the worſt, that delight to be ſo imployed.</p>
            <p>But indeed we find the Scriptures al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways diſcourſing Gods dealings with men at a higher rate of eſteem then this, and ſuing himſelf to all the moves againſt them, that they may be orderly and juſt, as if the Soul of man would reaſon and debate with him concerning his ways; for ſo indeed we find, there is a ſpirit in man, that in thoſe that are good, humbly and reverently deſires to plead with him, as in <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>Jeremy;</hi> and in evil men, contends and calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niates
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:59784:66"/> him as unequal, till he convinces them of all their hard ſpeeches againſt him.</p>
            <p>And the compariſon can never be equal betwixt man and any of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures under him; for they melt away from the leaſt preſſure into death, and ceaſe there: but man dated for Eternity, is therefore of a much higher conſideration; nor have the other thoſe notions of right and wrong, of rewards for doing well, and puniſhments for ill doing, that are implanted in mans Soul. God therefore paſſes into all the caſes of his rational Creatures, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines upon them ſo, that he will not regret or offend thoſe Principles which he himſelf hath put into them; but in all his Judgments and tryals of them, he comprehends their right in his own, and ſo ſentences them to miſery, as that it could not be otherwiſe conſiſtently with that Juſtice and Righteouſneſs he is to declare. All which are not only argued here in the world, in the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and low ſtate of Souls, and in this mixture of things, wherein a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not truly know love or hatred by any
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59784:66"/> thing that is before him; but in the clearneſs and open air of Eternity, when the ſpirits of men will be at their higheſt pitch, and multitudes of them aculeated with the ſting of an endleſs doom; while other Creatures lye ſtill in their duſt, and covered in their aſhes. Theſe immortal Souls challenging out of rottenneſs their bodies riſe up, &amp; plead with the Almighty concerning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. From whence we infer, that God doth not willingly afflict the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men ſo much as here, ſeeing it is he that hath put into them, and excites in them theſe powers of debate with himſelf, and thoſe reaſons upon which they argue; and he doth it, that he may be juſtified when he ſpeaketh, and be clear when he judgeth, and that it may be known, that all he doth is, as we have ſaid, upon accounts of Intereſt in his own glory, of ſincereſt intention for the good of his Creation, and of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for the righteous Government of the world. Of which accounts we ſhall treat particularly, having firſt laid down the fundamental reaſon of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <pb n="92" facs="tcp:59784:67"/>
            <p> The primary reaſon of Judgments is to be found in cloſe connexion with Juſtice and the nature of puniſhment. For Judgments upon a cloſe deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are the executions of puniſhment according to rules of Juſtice. The eſſence of this Juſtice, is in the diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every ones right to them by an exact ballance of reward and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment according to works, for the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of righteouſneſs and order in the world, which are both the beauty and peace of it. The ſupreme care of this is in the hand of Original Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and increate Juſtice, whoſe the world, and all the Creatures are, and which is ever awake upon this its Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramount Function.</p>
            <p>The nature of puniſhment is found only in pain, without which we can have no poſſible notion of it; for it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways imports to us ſomething grievous. And it ſtands upon this reaſon.</p>
            <p>Fruition and pleaſure are the laſt ends in which the deſires of man reſt as his happineſs; this is always his reach and contention, through what ways ſoever he ſteers himſelf: When he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:59784:67"/> through the mediums of honour or profit, or when he immediately graſps pleaſure it ſelf, or whether theſe be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or but apparently what he names them, the ſatisfaction ariſing from them is equally the deſign in all.</p>
            <p>This pleaſure or ſatisfaction is the taſt or reflection of man upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of things to his Nature, mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring delight through the mutual touch and embrace of them one with another, being thereto fitted by the wiſdom and goodneſs of the Author of Nature.</p>
            <p>This conveniency of things is called Good; the Fountain of it is God himſelf the Firſt Good; the ſtreams of it are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from him upon the ſeveral Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which flow one among another.</p>
            <p>True pleaſure God hath by great skill woven into Holineſs and gracious Action; theſe things being of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves moſt accordant to mans Soul: and further, by an eternal and unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able conſtitution (which is the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all propriety) ſet it as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of obedience to theſe Laws of Goodneſs; ſo that to him who perfectly obſerves them, the reward is reckoned

               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:59784:70"/> of debt; that the mind conſidering firſt this pleaſure ſpringing from good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, may be led to that as the root of it; then underſtanding it as a reward apportioned to virtuous actions, may be yet more fully invited there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
            <p>The whole complex of Good is hereby aſſured both in the preſent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations of things to this life and ſtate, and in the ſum of it, eternal life: For godlineſs hath the promiſes of this life, and of that which is to come; and they are rendred to them who by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient continuance in well-doing, ſeek for honour, glory, and immortality, the paths of which lead to that fulneſs of Joy in the preſence of God, and to thoſe Rivers of pleaſure at his right hand for evermore; which are the moſt commenſurate ſignifications of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, that which ſtands oppoſite to pleaſure, as darkneſs to light, or death to life, is pain; and it is the point from which the Fuga or averſation of the Soul haſtens it with all vehemency. This we ſtyle Evil; for
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:59784:70"/> it is the diſagreement of things to our Nature, which awakening reſentment, cauſes greateſt diſpleaſure.</p>
            <p>All this evil is by God ſeated in the heart of the evil of ſin, where its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per habitation is; for every impure action being diſſonant to the true make of mans Soul, is as far from pleaſure, rightly ſo called, as it is from goodneſs: and it is moreover prepared for the avenge of diſobedience, as its due por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and reward: From whence both the riſe of unhappineſs is known, and the reaſon underſtood; Death entred by ſin, and the wages of ſin is death, with all the preparations to it.</p>
            <p>This evil of puniſhment is admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred by the ſevere Touches of God himſelf as an adverſary, or the unfriend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſſures of the Creatures upon our Nature, ſet on by his wrath, either in the degrees now, or that complement Scripture calls Hell, where is wailing and gnaſhing of teeth in utter darkneſs, or utter impoſſibility of enjoyment.</p>
            <p>This conſtitution of things is the foundation of Religion, the pleaſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble both fruit and remuneration of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:59784:71"/> obedience, and the painful iſſue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of tranſgreſſion, being adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the inclining of the mind on each ſide of it; and the more neceſſary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe through the wiſe diſpoſition of things by God for the tryal of man, vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is beſet with preſent inconveniences (eſpecially ſince our Fall) which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the ſimple; and on the other ſide, the entertainments of folly and ſin have the ſweetneſs of ſtollen waters, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticement of Fools: but both theſe are counterballanced by the after and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rewards or puniſhments.</p>
            <p>Theſe things that are firſt proper to perſons conſidered ſingly, ſpread (as men themſelves do) and combine upon Nations and Communities: For that Juſtice we ſpeak of, is not only as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct as every man is to himſelf, but as large and general as the whole world, that Bodies of men may be awed with the ſame reaſons that ſeem to have greater place upon particulars, and be either proſperous, and ſpend their days in pleaſure; or calamitous, and travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing always with pain, according to their conformities with the Laws of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:59784:71"/> or prevarication from them.</p>
            <p>Let this then be reduced to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent purpoſe. Juſtice always intent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on its high adminiſtration, obſerves the ſins of men, paſſes ſentence upon them, and is ready to execute it. The ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence upon ſin is the intire ſum of pain and miſery, rolled up in that one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of dying the death; the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions, inſtruments, and ſeaſons are choſen by that higheſt wiſdom, that guides the diſpenſation of Juſtice, and the reſidue laid up in ſtore for the laſt Judgment, when the wicked ſhall be turned into Hell, and the Nations that forget God.</p>
            <p>From hence it is, that Judgments, the great vehicles of pain to the world, move up and down in it, by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of Juſtice to enforce tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors to receive that pain, which is the demerit of their ſin (in which elſe they would diſclaim their right) and to compel the Kingdoms of the Earth to drink certainly the Wine-cup of fury (however unwilling they are to it) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it duly appertains to them.</p>
            <p>Theſe things are ſo cloſe to mans
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:59784:72"/> Soul, that puniſhment is the next expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation after an offence; and if it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed, men are ready to cry out, Where is Juſtice? as if it were in a ſlumber: How reaſonable is this account then of Judgments, that there may be a due execution of Juſtice?</p>
            <p>In this Reaſon lye the ſeeds of theſe ſequent Reaſons of Judgments.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That there may be a ſenſe of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice preſerved in the world, as an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition againſt ſin. For theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions are evident as matters of fact, and counterſway the preſent pleaſure of ſin for a ſeaſon, by after-pains.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That there may be an expiation of the world; for ſatisfaction for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent given to Juſtice for ſin, is a purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>pro tempore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That men may have aſſurances of Judgment to come; ſeeing ſuch a thing as rendring vengeance that is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, leads to that is abſolute.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That God may change times and ſeaſons in his Government of the world; for pain unpins and forces the ſtate of things aſunder.</p>
            <p n="5">5. To reform men, by ſhewing their
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:59784:72"/> folly in ſhaping their courſe to the Country of pain and dolors, that they might find pleaſure.</p>
            <p>From this general conſideration, let us paſs to the particular reaſons of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, of which we proceed to ſpeak in order.</p>

               </gap>fter tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and to be compounded with, are not ſo eogent Arguments, but eaſily attributable to the common courſe of things. Theſe are ſo ſtill in view, and carried ſo temperately with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of natural cauſes, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding them, <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerves: Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is not ſpeedily executed upon wicked works; nor will men, who do
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:59784:73"/> not curiouſly inquire, know by them, whether there be a Juſtice over the world or not; and therefore ſtill the hearts of the Sons of men are ſet in them to do evil.</p>
            <p>For this cauſe God erects ſuch pillars of ſalt in the world, as Judgments, and they ſtand not only for the admonition of the juſt preſent, but they project their inſtructions upon ſucceſſion, even that which is moſt quiet and ſecure. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> obſerves, the great monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Judgments were raiſed to that ſtupendious height betimes, that they might over-look all decurrent Ages, and be ſeen by the laſt and loweſt of the world, that there might be none without ſuch cautions of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God. Their kind too was extraordinary; from Heaven imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, that the Argument might be more undeniable, and the impreſſion ſtronger.</p>
            <p>But how much the apprehenſion of ſuch a waking Eye upon all the ways of men, and the adminiſtrations of States and Kingdoms, is both to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, the good Government of the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59784:73"/> world, &amp; the Intereſt of man, may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out difficulty be underſtood. For as the Apoſtle expreſſing God in a jealouſie of the honour of his Goodneſs, ſays, he left not himſelf without witneſs, but ingaged the acts of mercy in giving fruitful times and ſeaſons: So in like manner do the diſtributions of his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice give teſtimony to him, that he judgeth in the Earth, ſo that all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of Righteouſneſs that are moſt naturally to be derived from ſo high a conſideration, may fall with greateſt force upon the minds of men. For as Judgments being abroad, are prevalent preachers of it; ſo thoſe that have been heretofore, being paſt, yet ſpeak: And the treaſure of that Juſtice and Power in God that inflicts them, is an unmove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able perſwaſion, that no change falls upon, and which indeed carries a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant force, without which thoſe that are paſt, would have ſoon been exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted and ſpent, and thoſe that are preſent included within themſelves.</p>
            <p>Take away the ſenſe of a Juſtice, and all rules of goodneſs are chilled into ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt notions, and moral ſpeculations
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59784:74"/> without any ſting; Laws grow feeble, and have only a precarious authority. And if the Juſtice be only humane, the Sphere is ſo narrow and reſtrained, that great wickedneſſes are committed out of its Jurisdiction and cogniſance. But Juſtice (and that Divine) commands and threatens with all higheſt confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and nothing can find exemption from it; laying ſtrongeſt warnings upon men, l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt they ſin, and giving greateſt motives to repentance after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions; ſpanning all reaſons for preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and removal of evil.</p>
            <p>Now there are no arguments of a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice ſo cogent, as thoſe it ſelf gives, which like things of ſenſe, find leaſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute when they are reſident by their own motion upon their proper ſubjects. For as the objects of ſenſe are to ſenſe, ſo are theſe ſtrokes of the hand of God to the conſcience; all fineneſs of conceit and tricks of wit, will not elude the ſtrength of things themſelves, taking place upon ſenſe: though they ſhould have inveigled the fancy at a diſtance from them; yet the firſt approach melts the vapour: yea though the Judgment
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:59784:74"/> ſhould have been reaſoned into a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and undertaken to give an Apa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, as the Stoick to his wiſe man; yet is it not of proof to the body againſt theſe realities, however it may defend the mind. Nor can the Atheiſt by all the turns of his perverted reaſon, eſcape the reciprocations of conſcience with the Juſtice of God, when he is attacqued by this preſſing hand; even unawares to himſelf he not only lets in, but often ſends out the confeſſions of it. But yet this difference there is between ſenſe and conſcience (which is a common ſenſe in the Soul) that the one depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the body is ſoon overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if it be too cloſely imbraced, or too long held, or too powerfully urged; when the other, properto a ſpirit, is the more awakened, and the more certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſeſſed by the earneſtneſs of things with it, that are properly agent upon it.</p>
            <p>Theſe Judgments then generally drawing from thoſe that are more incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to yield them; or preſſing from thoſe that are loth to give them ſuch acknowledgments that have raiſed and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:59784:75"/> continued an univerſal conſent in this Juſtice of God we diſcourſe of, make good this firſt reaſon we have propoſed; That God for his own Glory and the good of man, retains a ſenſe of Juſtice in the world; this ſenſe being ſo apt to keep an awe upon the Soul, deterring it from evil, and provoking it to good.</p>
            <p>It were but tything the Mint and Cummin of ſo weighty a conſideration, to add to it, that the very Intereſt of Government and civil Polity lies much in it; which cannot be better concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, then by offering to the Atheiſt the choice of his own mind, whether if there be certainly ſuch a Juſtice animadvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon mens ways, and this were as certainly and livelily acknowledged, it were not likely to give ſome better Law to the actions of mankind, then if there were no ſuch Juſtice, and it were certain to every one, there were no ſuch. He confeſſes enough, when he imputes the belief of it to the inſinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Rulers, as one of the neceſſary Arts to rivet their Decrees, and give them eaſe in wielding their Scepters.</p>
            <p>It may, no doubt, be far argued on the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:59784:75"/> ſide of virtue, righteouſneſs, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that they are the very weal of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; from whence the Atheiſtick pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor takes advantage, and carries him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf demurely upon it, as if no more were neceſſary to incline men of ſobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor any need of borrowing aid from imaginary Principles; but knowing unruly luſts are too boiſterous to be commanded by handſom diſcourſe, he provides the iron-hand of Laws and executions to ſubdue the more unbri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled part of men: which (ſaith he) ſhall go far, where the acknowledgments of a Deity can do nothing.</p>
            <p>Let ſuch a one conſider, there is a ſecret ſtrength conveyed up and down the world by the general conſent in this radical notion of a God and his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, which adds a much higher reaſon to the wiſeſt minds to ſway them, then the meer excellency of goodneſs it ſelf, which is not the leſs, but infinitely the greater for being hypoſtatiz'd in a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine will; and withal infolds the leſs ſenſible part of men, that what they do not conſider in its own worth, they yet upon the ſilent awes of conſcience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:59784:76"/> and drink in with much greater eaſe the commands of Authority that ſteer the ſame way; and more patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuffer the penalties of their tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, being firſt adjudged to them by themſelves.</p>
            <p>To ſum this; as the predictions of puniſhment before the execution, were acts of favour to men; ſo is the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Doctrine that grows out of the many experiments of this vindictive Righteouſneſs of God, a grace to the world, that it may not ſurprize un-un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood or unawares, but keep men in a daily regard to it, not running into its dang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

            <p>When it is often in the exerciſe of it ſelf, it can neither be unknown or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten. All which is moſt condecent to the infinite goodneſs and graciouſneſs of God, as well as to his Juſtice.</p>

The day of his righteous Judgment is the great purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it, when wickedneſs and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men ſhall be ſecluded the Creation into their own place. But though this be perfect and final, the Holineſs of God, and his goodneſs to his Creatures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a ſooner mitigation of ſo great an evil; which he provides for by theſe Ante-judgments.</p>
            <p>For ſin lying as an impurity upon the moral Creation of God, and under that upon the very natural, there muſt be a purgation ſuitable. All pollutions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſome kind of removal, elſe accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulating themſelves, they overload and deſtroy. In Nature things run through their own circle, wherein lye ſeveral ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients by which they acquit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:59784:77"/> from that Sordes they contract: when this is interrupted, ruine is their laſt reſort. The body dyes, and reſolves it ſelf, that it may part with that it had not power to expel, while it held toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Earth and air ſuffer thoſe convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and violent ſchiſms upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to work out of their bowels and boſoms unfriendly mixtures. The foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of ſin require higher and nobler purifications, or more ſevere depurga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: For the ſtain they caſt, being upon a more excellent ſtate, argues a deeper vitiouſneſs in that which defiles ſo high, and a more worthy expiation neceſſary; as the Apoſtle ſaies, the patterns of heavenly things (which he calls worldly) are purified with theſe legal ſacrifices; but heavenly things with better then ſuch. Our Saviours diſcourſe of meats not defiling the man, but that which comes out of the heart only, confines things within their own kind, natural within natural, ſpiritual within ſpiritual, and their defilements are peculiar to themſelves. Material things cannot riſe above themſelves in what they pollute, they cannot defile
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:59784:77"/> the man: All they do is within their Sphere, in which they roll out of one thing into another. Meats go in at the mouth, enter into the belly, and are caſt out into the draught: They run their round, and finiſh their motion among themſelves. To morrow blots out to day, and is it ſelf defaced by after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time. One thing wears off another, and all things are in the conſtant flux of the water, for their own purification. The body as it ſtands in a line with theſe things, is of no greater remark, the actions of it come into no greater account.</p>
            <p>But the ſpiritual ſtate is in all things great, the Laws of it are Royal, Laws of liberty, wiſdom, juſtice, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, elder then time, as ancient to the world as the decrees for the Sea, and rain, for the way of Thunder; then were they ſearched out and declared to man; equal they are as the ballance of the Clouds; juſt as the weights for the winds, as the ſcales in which the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains were weighed; certain as the Trochees of Nature, ere it was out of tune. All theſe have relation to God,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:59784:78"/> who is the head of this order, and gives a virtue and greatneſs to it. They are all everlaſting, and bear up themſelves conſolidate by Eternity.</p>
            <p>Man by his Soul is ſet in this heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly world, and can no more remove him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf out of it, then he can his body out of the material one; let his mind be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo high in its own elevation, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not keep the impreſſions of matter off from his earthy part; much leſs can he by ſenſuality untye his relation to ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituality, to which his Soul knits him ſo faſt; God having given a touch and feeling, a ſenſe and judgment, though it be not improved. Whatever a Soul doth, or doth not, that is, wherein it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes, or through neglect minds not to act, becomes moſt momentany; for all partakes the ſpirituality of its nature, and receives beauty or deformity, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity or defilement from the powers of that Law within it. A man cannot be a beaſt, though he degenerate like one.</p>
            <p>Sin then receiving force from the Soul that commits it, mounts the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Creation, and reſts it ſelf in the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:59784:78"/> world of Righteouſneſs, as a defilement in it adheres to it; as death, deformity, ſickneſs, emptineſs, darkneſs, do to the ſolid parts of the Creation; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by challenge a place in this world, which yet in themſelves are nothing but the want of the due perfection of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to which they adjoyn.</p>
            <p>Thus have we conſidered theſe two worlds as diſtinct; yet is there in this world an <hi>Ordo ad Spiritualia,</hi> through which it is inclaſped under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the higher, having a capacity to be ſublimated to ends above it ſelf, which is as a cement betwixt them both; whence it comes to paſs, that ſin deſcends upon the lower by neglect, or inverſion of the order wherein it ſtands: the firſt of which is to depreſs the works of God below his intention and aim at his own Holineſs in them, and is to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anul it: the latter is to debauch the Creatures of God to luſt, blotting out his ſuperſcription, and ſetting that of ſin in the room; and both are to build up evil grounded in matter to the third Heaven. Thus though meats cannot defile the man, yet the man may defile
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:59784:79"/> himſelf by meats, and defile the meats; as on the other ſide, meats commend him not to God; yet he may by a holy uſe, by the Word, and prayer, commend himſelf, and ſanctifie them: he is able by his Soul to touch them into gold, or to taint them with his own impurity.</p>
            <p>And this very innate power, though a man never conſiders it, nor behaves himſelf worthily by his judgment and caution of it, is yet the ſame as to the ſubſtance, as if he had a Soul never ſo greatned and inlarged by improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>When there is a defilement among ſpiritual things, every thing in the whole ſpiritual Nature keeps it extant, and puts a ſeal upon it; the certainty and unchangeableneſs of thoſe holy Laws; the all-ſeeing Eye of God; an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite mind and underſtanding, an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite purity, an everlaſting Juſtice and Judge; the conſent of the whole world of ſpirits with him; the immortality of the Soul, from which the defilement immediately riſes, and recoiling reſts. From whence it comes to paſs, that what men do with their Souls, they never
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:59784:79"/> loſe, but live in the midſt of all their actions, whether good or evil. For God keeping in force theſe Laws, retains and binds the Soul ſinning under the ſenſe of what it hath done, and ſends down the charges of his wrath into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and diſpatches puniſhments as he pleaſes, ever preſerving inviolable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of every tranſgreſſion, laid up within his own Juſtice, and regiſtred in the guilty breaſt, which ſucks in the air it hath breathed out, and if evil, is ſetled into a defilement ſo great, that nothing is pure to it.</p>
            <p>Let us then compute things, and when we find ſo many men in the world, whoſe actions are going out by hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds and thouſands, having no bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of righteouſneſs upon them, nor ſifted by any examination; but rolling down that great precipice and declivity of humane Nature all corrupted, not only with their own violence, but by the force of that power of darkneſs that concurs with them, what muſt the amount of the impurity then be?</p>

            <p n="1">1. That prime and eternal Holineſs, which with its Glory governs the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual order and beauty of things in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Holineſs, Righteouſneſs, and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as their firſt conſtitution; when offended by the ſin of any of the proper ſubjects of it, is ſecondarily repaired by puniſhment upon the ſinner.</p>
            <p>We may conſider this as abſtracted into its own moſt ſpiritual Nature, or formed into Laws, and either way pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment repairs it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If in its own ſpiritual Nature we look upon it, there is a ſplendour in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitive Juſtice, which is another mode of that Eternal Holineſs ſhewing it ſelf; it is the zeal and earneſt intention of it, meeting with any thing aliene and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded from it.</p>
            <p>The wrath of God is the flame, or light-fire of his infinite purity, in conteſt
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:59784:82"/> with iniquity; which gives ſuch a luſtre, that all the Earth is filled with this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and is an accidental illumination of the ſuperior ſtate of things: For which had there been no place, undoubtedly all entrances of ſin had been precluded. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of God, that he willing to ſhew his wrath, and make his power known, endured with much long-ſuffering the veſſels of wrath fitted to deſtruction. Knowing how to give reparations to himſelf, he permits to ſin and ſinners a ſcope in their own actions: There is yet no communion betwixt light and darkneſs, only another kind of efficacy of light. For that which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures not the approach of the leaſt evil, but by its own vigour and perfection throws it off with abhorrence and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, can never be defiled; but hath occaſion from evil to manifeſt its own intenſeneſs and ſupremacy, and preſerve in another way the ſame luſtre and greatneſs of the whole ſtate under it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If we conſider this Holineſs, as it is formed into Laws, wherein the ſtate of it is more plain, the firſt honour of a
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:59784:83"/> Law is obedience; if that be not paid, the ſecond is puniſhment, which keeps up the Majeſty and greatneſs of it, and even eſtabliſheth its authority; thoſe Laws being only weakned and infrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by tranſgreſſion, which go unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged; for then the power paſſes out of the Law, and ſettles in the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, which from thence aſſumes an authentickneſs, and damnes the Law to an obſoletion. But if the Law hath the offender in its hand to deal ſeverely with, and to condemn, the power is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently with it, &amp; it can terrifie into its obſervation, thoſe whom it cannot allure by its direction, equity, and rewards; which makes evil a feeble and weak thing: for whoever is bold in it, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes upon his own ruine, not only ſerving without protection, but under the certain penalty of dying the death. Thus a further potency of the Law is explained and opened, that elſe had lain hid at leaſt in the effect, <hi>viz.</hi> that it cannot only command, but avenge. It is true, the natural deſire of every good Law is to be obeyed, and to have the hearts of men burn in innocent flames of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:59784:83"/> affection and devotion to it, rejoycing more in its power to rule well, and do good: but when this is not accepted, the violater is ſtruck by the hand of it, that it may not betray its power to Anarchy and wickedneſs. All the Laws of God have therefore come armed into the world with threats and denuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of wrath, that the rebellions he foreſaw might not diminiſh ought from the greatneſs of them; and the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that gave being to thoſe threats, and made them true thunderbolts, have come profeſſedly to recompence the injuries done to his commands, and revenge their quarrel, that all may know There is a Government in the world.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Judgments are a great expiation of the ſpiritual world it ſelf. God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs the vicegerent powers under him to aſſoil themſelves and a Nation from community in piacular actions, by heaping the guilt upon the offenders head; which proceeding ſeparates the malefactor from the common maſs, and diſmembring him from the ſociety of which he was, diſintereſts that in the perpetration. This is the great mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:59784:84"/> of that excommunication recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by the Apoſtle as of ſo much uſe in the Church of God. This was the ſenſe of Sacrifices, in which beaſts commuted for men, attracted like common ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, ſymbolical guilt upon themſelves, and bydeath or that ceremonial exile of the Scape-Goat, were thruſt out of the world for the atonement of it. As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore things ſet apart to holy ends, and diſtinguiſhed from the ordinary heap, were Nazarited to God; ſo are perſons under this kind of devotion alſo, and have a more unhappy ſacredneſs upon them to his Juſtice, being herein Cathar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical to the reſt, put out from among them, &amp; forced down into the common receptacles of impurity. For when un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean things or perſons are reduced to their own place, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of <hi>Judas,</hi> they ceaſe to defile. We ſee throughout the world, pollution ariſes from the boldneſs of things (that for their unworthineſs and impurity ought to be by themſelves, and bound in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:59784:84"/> and ſubmits it ſelf to mean al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays; like the Sons of God falling in love with the daughters of men: But when noiſomneſs is ſtopped up in its own vaults, and caſt into its own lake, thoſe depurations preſerve the common air wholſome and free, and the great complex is not indamaged.</p>
            <p>That therefore which the Juſtice of man is too little and weak for, God who hath a much wide<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Jurisdiction, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms by extending his Anathematiſms, his greater or leſſer excommunications (as to his Juſtice appertains) upon greateſt Princes and Nations, till at laſt by that Anathema Maran-atha of caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into Hell, he makes a purgation ſo perfect, that nothing out of it hath the leaſt breath or exhalation of that great Sewer upon it. For were not that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation to the very utmoſt, it would certainly have been an annihilation; ſo incompatible is the foul ſtate of things with the pure, when brought to their everlaſting and incommutable point.</p>
            <p n="3">3. God gives a period to evil, and iniquity comes to an end by his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which ſometimes fall upon the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:59784:85"/> great Engineers, the workers of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and either cauſing them to drink the wine of aſtoniſhment, that they have no further ſpirits and life for ſin, or cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them off in the midſt of their work, force them to leave off to build their <hi>Babel;</hi> ſometimes he takes from them the inſtruments and matter with which they are at work, ſo that they have no more to do; or laſtly, the very Scene or Stage upon w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ich they are acting; the Cities and Countries that bore them, are as it were removed. Now when God doth any of theſe, there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows a great ſilence of evil, and a ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the further defilement of it; as a calm and ſtilneſs enſues, when great Tyrants that have made a huge noiſe in the world, go down into the nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt parts of the Earth, and lay their Swords under their heads: or as when Cities that have filled that circuit of Earth they took up with the ſound of their pomp and buſineſs, become a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, an unwonted quiet ſucceeds there, even then there is a preſent ſtop upon that conſtant ſtream of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that ran along with the duration
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:59784:85"/> of Princes and Cities in their flouriſh, till as their power and greatneſs riſes in ſome other part of the world, ſo a like impiety grows up out of their ruines; the whole courſe of time being ſpent in mowing down thoſegreat repullulations of ſin that are no ſooner cut and gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in one Age or place, but they ſpring in another, until the harveſt of the Earth is fully ripe, and the laſt time reaped by that ſickle that leaves nothing to be done after it: till then Hiſtory ſwells with theſe deſcriptions, and prophetick Writings moſt livelily repreſent ſuch vindemiations, and to the ends we have now diſcourſed.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Herein alſo are the Creatures freed from their unworthy ſervices; the righteous uſe that God makes of them, reſtoring them to that ſanctity that ſtood in dedication to himſelf; in which, if they ſuffer a reſemblance of puniſhment, as they firſt received a ſeemingly culpable imitation of mans ſin, it is but purgatorial; for the whole Creation is by Judgments in a degree now, at laſt perfectly freed from ſoil, and reſtored to its firſt and genuine clearneſs.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:59784:86"/> 5. Man himſelf who is the defiler and moſt defiled, is led by affliction to puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, if ſin hath not eaten ſo deep into him, that he is become one with that accurſed thing, and ſo him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf fit to be made a curſe.

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:59784:87"/> then the bare affirmation of it (though from him whoſe word is a Creation, that were enough) God ſets the realities of it before us; in which we may behold all in a little, as a man is drawn in an infant; and therefore he uſes to expreſs that little by the whole, that we might be the more acquainted with it: we ſee his power hereby to call to account whom he pleaſes, how, and when he pleaſes; he accuſtoms Nature to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent diſlocations before that final re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move. And becauſe our incredulity of it is ſo much and ſo faulty, beſides our other demerits, like <hi>Zachary,</hi> we are confirmed by a puniſhment inflicted on us for the time being: In our fleſh is printed the certainty of an Eternal Judgment by a temporary one, God chaſtiſing our unbelief as well as our ſins by this his hand; or as Chriſt evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his pardoning authority in Heaven by his pardon of ſins on Earth, that was by an act of his goodneſs expreſſed in ſuch effects of it, as men upon Earth meaſure the power of cauſes by: So theſe his Judgments drawn down to us where we are, and compoſed to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:59784:87"/> ſentiments, are the fitteſt demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of that which is as much above us as the Heaven above the Earth, &amp; of that to come; of which we are always doubtful, whether it will be or no: For with ſlender reaſon can we diſpute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the futurity of ſuch a Tribunal that is out of the reach of our calculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whether it ſhal be or not (had we not a revelation of it) who are daily ſurpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the wonders wrought before us, which we would not have believed, if they had been told us before they came to paſs, though much more near our Prognoſticks then the other. From whence we may well infer, All the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations we have of theſe things from God, ſhall certainly be fulfilled in their ſeaſon; ſince things ſo unexpected to us, the ſearch of which, and their likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods of event is not ſo far out of our depth, do yet appear, and all we have to ſay againſt them is but this, we never thought it. What may not then be, that is aſſured ſhall be in thoſe things we can pretend to no acquaintance with, though we are not aware of them before?</p>
            <pb n="126" facs="tcp:59784:88"/>
            <p> But further then this: when we ſee ſome times and perſons that have the marks of Judgment upon them, and that look as ſmitten of God; &amp; others again that have no ſuch ſcars, and yet we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but ſay, deſerve puniſhment, and often equally with the others: if there were not a Judgment to come, it would argue a partiality in that Juſtice, which yet we know is ſo great and free, that it accepts no mans perſon for being great, nor over-looks any as too ſmall for its eye.</p>
            <p>If there were not a Judgment to come, and that univerſal, our Saviours diſcourſe, that we ſhould not rate ſin and ſinners by their ſufferings here, would fall, when he ſays, All that do not repent ſhall periſh in like manner, that is, as notoriouſly as thoſe upon whoſe deſtruction the eyes of the world are ſet; and yet we ſee many flagitious perſons paſſing impune out of this life, having given charity it ſelf no hopes of their penitence: His perſwaſives of the neceſſity of repentance from thence, would be of no force or ſtrength, if there were not a Judgment to come,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:59784:88"/> and a periſhing beyond all we ſee here.</p>
            <p>There were no place of Argument, if it could eſtabliſh it ſelf ſo great againſt Divine Providence and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, or againſt all Religion and Chriſtianity, as that which ſuppoſes, there is no everlaſting and final deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination further off then now, to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile the great inconſiſtencies of things with their diſorders, which do but ſeem to be, becauſe there is a Judgment, but would indeed be, if there were none.</p>
            <p>If then there be ſuch a day of God, and his righteous Judgment, and the leſſer acts of it deſerved meſſengers of ſo immediate a miſſion, ſealed often with miracles; that which is ſo much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and in which all is ſummed by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, ſhould have the moſt ſolemn embaſſie; accordingly God takes care, for the Doctrine of it is delivered by his Son, and confirmed by his Reſurrection from the dead.</p>
            <p>All the Judgments of God from the very beginning down to the end, offer themſelves as the premonitions of that Day; the eldeſt Prophets ſpake of it, <hi>Enoch</hi> the ſeventh from <hi>Adam</hi> ſaid, The
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:59784:89"/> Lord cometh with ten thouſands of his Saints; and the moſt ancient of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Angels thrown into chains of darkneſs, declare the Judgment of that great Day; becauſe it is the acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of Providence that hath ſeemed crooked here, while it hath run through the mazes of the froward and ſtrange ways of men, and therefore appeared as confuſed and intangled as they. God not depending upon time, as an unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable or indiſputable repreſentation of his Rule of the world, hath throught it worthy of himſelf to provide by a laſt Judgment to aſſoil his Government of it from all poſſible calumny, by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the greatneſs of his skill then, in thoſe croſs lines, thoſe ſhades and lights that encounter one another now, and look like perplexity and errour in the parts, but in the whole picture will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent adorable wiſdom, excellent in this above all, that it hath made every thing with ſuch aſpects upon this end of things, and with ſuch direct motions to this center: If that therefore were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, the ſeveral lines and paths in the world would lead no whither, nor
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:59784:89"/> reſt any where; and not only ſo, but the great points of Chriſtianity leaning upon this Poſtulare, would fall. As therefore God doth indeed haſten all things hither, that they might not wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der over-long, though by a meaſure of time, that ſeems tedious to us, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any delay in himſelf, or in the thing it ſelf: For yet a little time, and he that ſhall come, will come, and will not tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: So doth he ſupport the inclining faith of men concerning it with all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable aſſurances of it; that what it will fully do at laſt, it may proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably do now, if it be not wilfully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believed and ſlighted.</p>

            <p>WHen from the ſins of men, and Gods Government over them, ariſe thoſe reaſons of Judgment of ſo deep an Intereſt in his Righteouſneſs and Goodneſs, as we have already gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:59784:90"/> and ſhall yet add; it is no way diſhonourable to God to interpoſe this, as one account of Judgments, That he takes occaſion from hence to variegate his adminiſtration and providence, and to adorn that great Table of Time with thoſe mixed colours, which when ſeen at that true light we laſt ſpoke of, will reflect the beauty of infinite under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and wiſdom, as in a curious piece of Tapeſtry, the pleaſure of which is its well placed diverſity, when we ſee it on the right ſide, and fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded; till then it may ſeem an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skillful confuſion. God, I ſay, takes advantage from the ſins of men thus to govern the world by his Judgments, not that there was any thing new to Providence in the breaking out of ſin, that it did not think of before: yet it became the infinitely good and holy Creator to give the firſt model of things anſwerable to himſelf, and when out of deep Counſel he determined to ſuffer a perturbation, even then to undertake the guidance of thoſe many croſs and unruly motions, that certainly fall out upon ſo great a diſorder for the further
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:59784:90"/> diſplays of his Eternal underſtanding. As the skill of the Painters hand may be as great, and appear far greater, the ſudden varieties giving an advantage, and the difficulty enhanſing the Art, when he draws a confuſion, then when he ſhadows an accompliſhed piece of order; and the prudence of a Leader more known, when it turns it ſelf to every accident, in a mutiny or ungo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned medley, then when it leads a well-governed Army, and only keeps pace with the known Rules of Military Diſcipline. It is firſt moſt natural to God to rule, and to rule with infinite wiſdom and goodneſs; next having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted things to diſtemper through the ſin of man, to over-rule that very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, to ſet off the excellency of his own conduct by it: For when the ſins of men have brought it to that paſs, that there muſt be Judgments, it is moſt worthy of God, that by them the ſtate of the world ſhould be alſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged, which if that caſe had not been put, ſhould have been conducted by mercy only. But now Judiciary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence is a bridle, that God puts into
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:59784:91"/> the mouth of humane affairs, and turns about the whole body of them how fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and fiery ſoever: It is a Helm with which he wheels about the moſt bulkie actions, and driven of boiſterous winds, raging and impetuous paſſions: It rolls down States and Governments, and carries huge mountains of times and ſeaſons before it. Dominion is whirled about to ſeveral points; Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies are daſhed in pieces, that could have preſcribed for themſelves, and others riſe out of their aſhes. He di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides the Nations, and the everlaſting Hills bow themſelves; he weighs and meaſures out Princes; he gives the Earth to whom he pleaſes; he ſhews his ſigns and tokens in Heaven and Earth by his Judgments, and in theſe things none can ſtay his hand either with pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſeeing every thing depends upon him; nor by reaſon or pleas of right, ſeeing all that he gave is forfeited back into his hand by ſin. Of this reaſon of Judgments Scripture is not at all ſilent, but avows with higheſt confidence the tranſlation of things according to the pleaſure of God, who worketh all things
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:59784:91"/> after the counſel of his will; who crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all things, and for whoſe pleaſure they are and were created, and yet he never moves them from their reſt, but with juſt reſpects to ſin; for he takes pleaſure in righteouſneſs. The righteous Lord loveth righteouſneſs, and his Throne, the Emblem of his Dominion, hath its habitation as well in equity as Judgment, and exerciſe of power.</p>

For there is nothing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God is more gracious to man, then in thoſe advantages he gives him to return
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:59784:92"/> to a right mind: when he takes thoſe methods that are rough and ſevere in themſelves, and makes uſe of them for medicine, they loſe whatever is hard and grievous in them, &amp; are even chuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable thus far, That it is more to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired God ſhould chaſtiſe, and not hate us, then with a greater indignation and revenge not be angry with us. It is better we ſhould paſs through his fire, then be unpurged, and even boiled in his Cauldron, melted in his Furnace, and brayed in his Mortar, then remain in our own impenitency, droſs, and folly.</p>
            <p>God the beſt as he is the greateſt, in thoſe things wherein he is moſt potent, is alſo moſt benigne, and therefore caſts beams of his goodneſs upon his moſt dreadful diſpoſes: He made not the night without ſome beauties of the day. As the Father of Heaven and Earth, and more peculiarly of the ſpirits of men, he takes care of his off-ſpring and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily with the bowels of the Father of mercies. But then as the infinite Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as the Ruler and Judge of all the world, he plants all his works, even of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:59784:92"/> mercy, in righteouſneſs: from both which ariſe a diſcipline moſt conduci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the participations of his Holineſs, guiding us firſt by Rules, and after ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhing us by corrections, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing us by chaſtiſements, which are moſt proper acts of a paternal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>This ſweetens and mollifies thoſe more awful reſpects he carries upon the world, as ſupreme in his Dominion and Judgment, though even in thoſe, it is agreeable with increated mercy to leave nothing untryed and without its experiment, that might conduce his Creatures; much more, as he governs the world in a Mediator, all his rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to mankind are infinitely endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and made kinder by the preſence of God with us.</p>
            <p>While this reaſon of all others doth moſt, not only vindicate, but addulce and commend theſe ſeverities of God to us, becauſe it ſtands ſo fair with all his Attributes, and level with the good of man, we will take a freer account of the uſe of Judgments under it.</p>
            <p>In the general we may underſtand,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:59784:93"/> there is nothing in the works of God, ſo thin or volatile, as for ſight only, but would imbody &amp; fix it ſelf in uſe. In Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelf, thoſe things which afford us only ſpeculation, becauſe we have not the Mechanicks of them in our own hand, nor any Engines to move them with, are yet in their own place full of that common labour and induſtry <hi>(So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> ſpeaks of) to ſerve the world, and by the ſcrews of one thing upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, faſtned on them in Creation, they are applyed more effectually to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ends, then thoſe that are elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by our ſelves, and carried by our endeavour and art to the private ends of our neceſſity and pleaſure.</p>
            <p>In Religion, the moſt myſterious parts of it, and which we think furtheſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from action, are yet indeed the pillars of it, and richeſt ſprings of a heavenly converſation; like the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior bodies, that being far above us, are yet the ſource of all the vigour and fruitfulneſs of moral precepts, that, as the Earth, are nearer us.</p>
            <p>Judgments are yet moſt evidently deſigned for our practice; for (as we
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:59784:93"/> ſee) all approaches of pain quicken to ſome kind of action, and diſcuſs that lethargick humour that benummes and deads us; nothing ſtands ſtill to feel and contemplate its own miſery: and when this is underſtood to be the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſuration of ſo knowing and juſt a hand as Gods, it calls us to acts that become us; and while it calls us, it alſo excites us, and after a phyſical manner, diſpoſes us to thoſe reſpects to his counſels and ends in adminiſtring puniſhment. According to which No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we ſhall propoſe our following me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation herein.</p>

         <div n="11" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. XI. <hi>Of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe true Reaſon may make of the aſſurance Senſe hath of the Evils we call Judgments; and how far it may advance toward Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>BEfore we enter upon the more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect powers of Judgment in order to practice, let us ſee what will neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily follow from Gods ſetting ſuch a
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:59784:94"/> thing as Adverſity in the world, and what advantages to the Doctrine of Chriſtianity, as worthy all acceptation, will flow from this naked conſideration by eaſie inferences, as conſectaries from Principles.</p>
            <p>We will then take but thus much, that is moſt undoubted: That humane condition is very obnoxious to unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and miſery, whether we conſider it as united into Communities, or bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into ſingle perſons. It is a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of trouble, man is born to it, as the ſparks flye upward. All Hiſtories, Ages, Families, Perſons, and Sects of men are agreed in this, becauſe it is evident to ſenſe.</p>
            <p>Our ſenſes are thoſe agents and emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of our Souls, that we moſt truſt, and in whoſe intelligence we moſt eaſily ſettle, and with leaſt doubt. God hath therefore taken care Religion ſhould have ſome foundation here, even in the certain and unqueſtionable aſſurance of ſenſe.</p>
            <p>That it is appointed to all men once to dye, is a reſolution of unexceptiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble experience; and upon this, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:59784:94"/> have raiſed great ſtructures of moral wiſdom and practice. That there is a world of creatures in ſo great a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety, and yet framed with aſpects up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſubordinacies one to another, is in no mans power to deny: all our ſenſes bring us every moment ſtrong aſſurances of theſe things, like one poſt after another, that Scepticiſm about them is but a ridiculous madneſs. How do theſe preſs to the acknowledgment of a God! peſtilences, famines, deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by war, and the miſeries attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, are ſuch known things to us, that we cannot doubt. And how do theſe urge to the awe of a Juſtice! For upon this indubitable Philoſophy of ſenſe, fall in thoſe common notions, wherein man is taught, by reading, what is written in his heart. They come into the former, as light upon the Fabrick of the world, that ſhews us the uſe and ends of every thing, and invites to acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And theſe have as ready an aſſent in mans Soul, and would have as general an agreement of mankind in them, as the other, were it not that men finding them in the way of their irreligious and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:59784:95"/> ſenſual practice, are neceſſitated to call them into queſtion, as far as they can, and accuſe them of incertainty or fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhood, which firſt impeach their ways of folly, and condemn them of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. For the Law is a continual grief to them that are out of the way. From hence diſcourſes to the diſhonour of ſuch awful Heſts have a pleaſingneſs, and give advantage to thoſe that affect a reputation by diſſenting from the moſt received Principles, to ſpeak of them, as if they were the common cheats into which the herd of people are either driven, or abuſed; while they to whoſe lives ſuch Harangues are ſet, cannot indeed believe what they ſeem to admire ſo much. But when we conſider, the great ſentiments of Religion have their trueſt reverence for their relation to another world; and few think, but that the preſent might be well enough managed without them, being altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther careleſs of the other: It is not to be conceived, how they are continued ſo certain among men in ſpight of the combination againſt them, if they had not an evidence in mans Soul, paſt the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:59784:95"/> cunning of any deſign poſſibly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe or remove. Not to mention the exotick Characters of them in thoſe parts which have had no commerce with the learned world, moſt reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to be ſuſpected of ſuch artifice.</p>
            <p>But we will firſt reaſon upon that acknowledgment, which bears no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of opinion: That is,</p>
            <p>There are ſuch univerſal unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes in the world, which comprehend greateſt Powers, and Bodies of men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe that graſp more frequently, and with greater liberty, private fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies and perſons. Touching which we will alſo ſuppoſe a while, that they are no more then certain revolutions and conjunctions, or but the play and ſport of things againſt humane condition.</p>
            <p>And raiſing things no higher then thus, yet we ſhall find ſo much towards God and Chriſtianity, even hereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced, upon but a wiſe and manly computation of things, that will make the reſt much more eaſie, and ſurprize us with the reaſonableneſs of the whole beyond imagination, that ſenſe could have contributed ſo much to Religion.
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:59784:96"/> For what man of Soul can deny, but that ſeeing all worldly things are ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant, and ſo often adverſe; humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, indifferency to the world, and the happineſs of it; ſobriety, a temperate uſe of all things, contentment with our condition, patience, are virtues created even of neceſſity? and if theſe were admitted and received in their full ſtrength, how eaſie would the aſcent from them to the higher Principles of Religion be? He that is thus initiated, would find freer approach to the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of Godlineſs, and take the Dye of it by being thus coloured firſt.</p>
            <p>And yet, except we ſhall count all but dream and miſtake, that ever hath riſen from the Soul and ſenſe of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; except there be no ſuch things as reaſon and diſcourſe, theſe things muſt be received. And ſurely the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of our minds concerning them, are as plain, and commanding, as that we have bodies, and that they have motion, and are ſubject to ſuch impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions as they are.</p>
            <p>Let us further argue herein, leaving out ſtill the ſuppoſition of a God and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:59784:96"/> his Judgments: And what can we take inſtead of what I have propoſed, but the Senſualiſts, Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we dye; let us crown our ſelves with Roſe-buds before they be withered; that is, let us ruffle as high as we can in all manner of pleaſure and ſenſual fruition how impure ſoever, while we have ſeaſon, and in a moment go down to the dead: Let us take the mirth and jollity the preſent time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords, not fore-ſtalling unhappineſs with preconceipts of it; and when worſe comes, let us bear it as well as we can, but throw from us all thoſe fantomes of a mind or virtuous conſideration, as if they were only air, and breath for their truth, and of no ſervice to man, but to torture and deprive him of all enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Now this doth ſo violently deſpoil a man of all he can be ſuppoſed to have an underſtanding given him for, and turns him into the condition of a beaſt, that it cannot ſeem credible, man ſhould have powers given him, and poſſibilities of conſideration above ſuch a ſtate, and nothing at all to do with them. We ſee
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:59784:97"/> in all other creatures their action and their powers are equal, except we could imagine, that beaſts have phanſies and contemplations of things of a higher ſtate then their own.</p>
            <p>But who that hath not forfeited all ſober face, dares owne ſo brutiſh a life, who doth not deteſt ſuch a debaſement of reaſon, that it ſhould either have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do, or no more then ſenſe can do in the Beaſts?</p>
            <p>Yet leſt this ſhould be too much to be conſident upon, we will only ſay, There is a great diſpoſition in the mind and Soul of man, that is never ſo little opened and unfolded by ingenuity, education, or obſervation of it ſelf, to improve it, and compoſe it ſelf by reaſon to an excellency ſtanding in virtue and magnanimity, to caſt the accounts of evil, publick or private; and to ſecure it ſelf firſt by moderation and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawment from all theſe outward things; then by the better enrichments of ſelf with knowledge and goodneſs: laſtly, to flanck it ſelf with patience and reſolution, that it may be defended on every ſide againſt whatever can befal it on the right hand or the left.</p>
            <pb n="145" facs="tcp:59784:97"/>
            <p> That men of Philoſophy have flown this pitch without any tincture of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, or colour of the Doctrine of the Scriptures upon them, is enough known: That they have diſcourſed of greatning their ſpirits againſt all aſſaults of Fortune, of conſtancy of mind raiſed upon the confidence of a mans native excellency, and domeſtick riches, out of the reach of all extern diſorder, thoſe writings of theirs ſo much magnified, and worn by every hand, teſtifie.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, ſeeing every man feels within him an Impetus to purſue that firſt-born deſire to be happy; he that goes about it conſiderately, muſt needs find, There can be no ſuch thing as happineſs in the outward man, whoſe condition is ſubject to every change.</p>
            <p>The room of the body is indeed too narrow and cloſe, the receipts of it too dark and pent, to entertain ſo great a preſence as happineſs; but beſides this, the acceſſes are too open to pain and miſery, the ſound and noiſe of all kind of diſturbance is ever about it, and one time or other the things crowd in upon it. But happineſs is even, and all alike;
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:59784:98"/> it is a conſiſtency, a perpetuity, or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: A perpetuity, that at this time we date not into Eternity, but allow that to be ſo, which fills up its own meaſure, and runs out to its own utmoſt length; that in this caſe we allow to be ſo, that is commenſurate with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent life and being in the world. But it is impoſſible to preclude the preſſures of evil from this moment; for no man can tell how ſoon a diſeaſe bred within his own walls, ſhall wage a war againſt him, and blaſt all his contentments; how immediately a violence from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſhall rob him of what moſt pleaſes him. Whoever then will lodge any ſuch thing as a felicity within himſelf, muſt retire it into this appartment of his Soul, and himſelf ſequeſtred from body, and diſſolved from it, muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat into ſpirit, that he may enjoy it: He muſt forſake all things beyond the line of mind, and looking upon them as the daily prey of every contingent, be wholly unconcerned what becomes of them; though he uſes them while they are to be had, yet with greateſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency, coolneſs, and freedom from
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:59784:98"/> them, and even then deſpiſing them, when he ſeems to enjoy them. He muſt bear the ſtrokes of evil with that part alone upon which they fall, and never let them touch his mind. In the mean time he muſt raiſe and ennoble his Soul, and carry all kind of treaſure into it, that is proper for it; he muſt fortifie, and environ it on every ſide with cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and longanimity; he muſt watch, that it be not betrayed by luſt or inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate affection, nor made weak and falſe by ſuch correſpondencies which do not only open an avenue to ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but leave a guilt behind them; of which, though we ſuppoſe no higher Judge then himſelf, yet the reverence he owes to his own authority, and the ſeverity he feels from himſelf, when that is offended, obliges him to inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency.</p>
            <p>Thus while he hath a being in the world, he maintains it in peace and greatneſs; firſt not taken and decoyed out of himſelf by the general applauſe of pleaſures, riches, and honours, he hears in the world; nor ſunk below himſelf, when he finds any of theſe gone,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:59784:99"/> whoſe ſervice he accepted, ſo as to be well without them, though he did not moroſely refuſe them, but either when through their own inconſtancy they change their maſter, or are compelled to leave him; he is yet the ſame he was, living in himſelf, and ſupplyed in all things by himſelf: For he hath taken the elevation of every thing in the world, and of his own Being; he hath ſet down the incertainty of theſe things, and therefore he is not amazed at what he expected; he hath taken the eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of wiſdom and vertue, and finds them invaluable in their price, unmove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in their nature; his buſineſs is therefore to fabricate his mind for them: Theſe are his happineſs, that do not feel the pain of a diſeaſe, the cruelty of a ſword, the pinches of a famine; his Soul is the Cabinet of them, that nothing from without can either find or touch, while it keeps it ſelf diſtinct, and alone from the body, which it viſits by a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary charity and care of it, but dares not mix with it, leſt it firſt be inſecured with its luſts, and after infected with its miſery.</p>
            <pb n="149" facs="tcp:59784:99"/>
            <p> Thus hath Reaſon in the dark, and unenlightned by Sacred Truth, ſelt out happineſs, and having enough from ſenſe, that it could not be out of the Soul, hath placed it within. But if there be no better ſtate beyond this life, who feels not a compaſſion, that ſuch a man as hath been deſcribed, muſt dye; that ſo great a Soul that can protect it ſelf, while it is in motion and action, muſt yet be ſuppreſſed by death; that he whoſe reaſon and magnanimity endures the torture, muſt yet be ſilenced and ſtupified by Fate! Who doth not wiſh that Soul ſhould out-live that body in a perfecter ſtate, that lived now ſo much above and beyond it? Yea, who would not deſire that that Soul that had ſo well commanded a body, ſhould have a glorious one to ſhine in, and that out of the aſhes of that body in which ſuch a Soul dwelt, and taught it virtue, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other more perfect ſhould riſe?</p>
            <p>In the mean time, would not juſt cauſe of complaint ariſe, if Fortune or a blind courſe of things, ſhould have any diſpoſe of, but the outſide of ſuch a man? Who would not deſire there
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:59784:100"/> ſhould be a God, who with skill firſt exerciſes virtue into a luſtre, and then rewards it? Who that hath any love to virtue, would not bewail it, if there were no other difference between virtue and vice, then what is ſeen here; and rejoyce in an Eternal Judgment that would illuſtrate and crown it? Who would not wiſh virtue ennobled with the love of ſo bleſſed a Being as God, and that it ſhould be made more conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable by pleaſing him; that it ſhould be enriched by the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt, ſo great an Exemplar of it in our nature; that it ſhould be aſſiſted by the bleſſed Spirit of Grace, without which it cannot ſuſtain it ſelf? And who that behaves himſelf thus in the world (as we have deſcribed) can but think the Principles of Chriſtianity would beſt fit his purpoſe and manner of life, and therefore be willing to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſe them? For though this we have inſiſted upon, be all a man can do, and that he muſt do to retain any thing o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:59784:100"/> very jejune and cold, when alone; vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue without Chriſtianity is but like the temporary and periſhing things of the world, that make a blaze, and then go out. Though that of virtue be the pureſt, yet it is as ſoon quenched by death; and while it is, it wants much of the true alloy and reaſon: For ſo great an object of goodneſs, whom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually to love and adore, ſo great a Spectator and Judge, ſo gracious a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Spirits, and their excellent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments, as God, makes as great a difference in theſe things, as the light of the Sun doth in the world, compared with the light of the Moon; and as the influences of the one ſurpaſs thoſe of the other, ſo do the virtues falling from the knowledge of God and Jeſus Chriſt, excel thoſe chiller irradiations of Moral Diſciplines, when ſeparated from Diviner Fire.</p>
            <p>But we have thus far argued from the ſentiments of Morality upon Senſe, that we might from thence conclude; Seeing there is no ſecurity for man in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded ſtate of Body and Soul, and that yet the appetite of man contends
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:59784:101"/> towards happineſs with ſo much ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs, he muſt either be a beaſt ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling all motions but of ſenſe, and the juſt preſent ſatisfaction; ſo that he may enjoy himſelf, when things are well, and ſuffer as a beaſt, when evil falls upon him, without any agitation of a mind: or elſe he muſt be an Angel, removing his chief intereſts out of the body.</p>
            <p>This wiſe men, without any ſuſpition of ſubordination from Chriſtianity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, and therefore the ground on w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> true Religion ſtates all things, muſt needs be to Morality, that is not ſullen and prejudiced, the moſt acceptable: For ſageſt Ethicks (guided by Chriſt indeed, as <hi>Cyrus</hi> by God, though they knew him not) acknowledged this concluſion of the matter, That there muſt be ſome higher end of men then the body, and that all his condition muſt be reſigned to that; and hereupon waded as far as they could into thoſe deeper Doctrines of the Immortality of the Soul, a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a future ſtate, beſides that which was much opener to them, the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of the Firſt Being, God.</p>
            <p>Now he that upon theſe grounds
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:59784:101"/> dyes to his fleſh to live in his Soul, is not far from the Kingdom of God and Chriſt; which teaches a man to deny himſelf, and ſow his preſent life to let it dye as a grain of wheat, which except it dye, abides alone (that is) can never be any more then it is, but loſes it ſelf at laſt; whilſt that which ſubmits it ſelf to a ſhort death, in expectation of a better reſurrection, propagates it ſelf to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>The aſſurances of Everlaſting life at the end, and in the mean time that no imaginable thing, either height or depth, life or death, what is preſent or to come, ſhall ſeparate from that love of God in Chriſt, which makes more then a Conqueror in all, are true grounds of the happineſs of man, and only ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient herein.</p>
            <p>All theſe Chriſtianity hath the honour to reveal, and yet Morality hath ſo great need of to impe it ſelf with, that if it were it ſelf alone, it muſt needs adore this Revelation; however as it is blended in men with corruption of Nature, and planted among thoſe roots of bitterneſs that ſpring up and defile it,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:59784:102"/> it may profeſs an emnity; yet certainly as thoſe Heathen Princes paid a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to that God that had foretold their ſucceſſes by his Prophets, ſo it is impoſſible but all wiſe uſe of reaſon muſt needs ſay of the Doctrine of Chriſt, There is a divine thing in it, ſeeing it doth not only eſtabliſh the ſame rules of life with that reaſon, but advances the encouragements of them to the very Heavens.</p>

            </head>
            <p>HItherto we have from evidence of ſenſe ſtated things, as if man find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in a poſture generally adverſe to him, were by his own wiſdom and virtue to make the beſt of himſelf, and to riſe by it, as much above the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the creatures below him, as his underſtanding exceeds theirs: and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:59784:102"/> thus, we have fathomed the excellencies of Chriſtian Religion, without which Morality ſinks very low. But we come now into a debate upon thoſe Principles ingraffed in mans heart, heightned by the Word of God, even as the ſenſitive Soul is elevated by the preſence of the rational; or as the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is advanced by the Spirit of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting it, <hi>viz.</hi> That there is a God, an Eternal condition, that all calamities upon humane Nature are from God and his Juſtice for ſin.</p>
            <p>And who that is wiſe would leave ſo ſtrong a ſenſe as his Soul hath of theſe things, unſatisfied, unanſwered? Or why ſhould a man be truly dealt with by his eye and ear, his taſt and touch, and that common ſenſe that weilds them, and deceived by that inward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, his mind? Why ſhould it be true, there are wars, plagues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that theſe are grievous and deſtructive; and not be true, that God puniſhes by them? Senſe is ſure of the one, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate reaſon of the other; the reports of which are as confident and earneſt, and if heeded, moſt prevailing and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective:
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:59784:103"/> For as the univerſality of men believe ſenſe about its own objects, ſo do they acknowledge theſe Principles even againſt themſelves, when in their evil actions they wander from them. If evil practice be taken for an argument againſt good Principles, why is not ſelf-condemnation for that evil pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, a much ſtronger argument on their ſide, eſpecially ſeeing it is taken for no ſufficient Plea againſt aſſurance of ſenſe, that men moſt conſiderable disbelieve it, and act contrary to it (wherein it pretends beyond it ſelf againſt truer dictates) that they may obey the ſadder reſolves of their minds? Or who that is any thing ſuſpitious and examinative, as every man in this wilderneſs of things hath reaſon to be, would be careleſs of ſo valuable and reverend a Record as the Word of God? which he ſees ſo great and wiſe a part of men for ſeveral Ages, have had ſuch an awe of, and found ſo great an efficacy in. Every one conſcious of reaſon in himſelf, cannot but attend to him that ſpeaks gravely and ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, and think him worthy to be heard, and the more, when he knows
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:59784:103"/> he is eſteemed and attended to by thoſe of whom he is bound to think, if he have underſtanding himſelf, they have it alſo. But moſt of all in this caſe, he hath cauſe to beware how he deſpiſes, when he converſes with that ſo venerable a repreſentation of things, that vouches it ſelf to be divine, and is ſo received by ſo great and grave an Aſſembly, as the Church of God in all Ages; into which if he patiently and ſeriouſly inquire, and adviſe with it, he ſhall find ſuch an auguſt preſence of truth in it, that he muſt needs acknowledge more then humane. For as men print their Souls, and the ſtrength of reaſon they carry, into their writings, and he that reads them intelligently, traces the ſagacity of that mind that moved in them, gild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its own paths; ſo is the wiſdom of God to be found in his Word, and that power and ſenſe of mans Soul that judges of things divine, as reaſon in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral doth of rational, will ſay, God is in it of a truth.</p>
            <p>Let us then obſerve the Oracles of our own minds, and thoſe livelier of the Scripture concerning Judgments, and
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:59784:104"/> what muſt neceſſarily be inferred from them.</p>
            <p>Firſt, it is plain from hence, affliction hath no root of its own, nor doth it riſe up out of the duſt; it is not only the unavoidable claſh of things one againſt another, but all the unhappineſs and pain that is in the world, muſt be an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of an infinite Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Power, who hath all the organs of evil in his own power, aad no inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it is out of his hand. This is the preſent reſolve of mans mind: For as the Soul of man can riſe no higher in its thoughts, or ſurmiſes of any thing or Being then to God; ſo if it be not ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, as in ſenſeleſs ignorant men, or ſtopped and forced to be quiet, as in the Atheiſt, it cannot reſt, but ſearches and ſoars, and mounts it ſelf, till it comes to ſomething infinite, perfect, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine; and when it is come thither, it moſt plainly profeſſes it can go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it being impoſſible to exceed ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely perfect and infinite.</p>
            <p>Thus it is in the general, and thus it is in this particular caſe, <hi>viz.</hi> in the queſt it makes after the higheſt cauſe of evil,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:59784:104"/> it cannot ſtay till it diſcovers God; it cannot be ſtill lower, nor ſtir higher then him; the under-ſcale of things ſerves only to lead up to him.</p>
            <p>For though all things are indeed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable from their power to hurt; yet if they cannot move themſelves, but are guided by a ſuperior hand, we muſt go up to that, ere we underſtand the head of our unhappineſs: when we find this to be God, who is a Being infinitely good, we know he afflicts not willingly, he is diſpleaſed &amp; angry becauſe of ſin, which puts the Soul into a neceſſary agony of ſeeking reconcilement with him.</p>
            <p>The being of man is ſo lovely to him, that he cannot but deſire to preſerve it; and yet the well-being of this being is ſo much more deſirable, that he had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther quit it, then retain it miſerable: From hence ariſe thoſe fears and ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we have of every thing, which our reaſon and experience tell us can do us injury: but our greateſt fear muſt needs be of the greateſt evil, the wrath of God. For it is the fear of a power above us, that can reach us at pleaſure, that is always preſent to us, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:59784:105"/> all ways of puniſhment, ſo that it cannot be prevented or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peded, nor can we ſave any thing from it: when a man draws out himſelf to a longer Being, and finds himſelf conſigned for Eternity, the knowledge of God eternal in his wrath, continues his fears to that Eternity; there being the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and principle of this wrath coae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val.</p>
            <p>It is palpably vain to enter a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with little and petite powers of evil, to make our peace by, when this greateſt is inſecured; whoſe power is, as the Heavens to the Earth, that flows round about it, and compaſſes it every way. But when a man is at peace with God, the whole body of evil is ſetled, commanded, and compoſed.</p>
            <p>The Scripture therefore to correct our vain fears, and to guide that paſſion or affection of fear aright, goes down to the very center of it, and with trueſt wiſdom explains to us the great object of it, God, and that firſt Mover of all miſery, his wrath and diſpleaſure, the ſuſpenſion of which is the quiet of the world, the removal of it our eternal conſolation.</p>
            <pb n="161" facs="tcp:59784:105"/>
            <p> It is therefore of greateſt neceſſity we make our peace with him; for then we have a league with all: before this eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry whiſper and ruſtle, every noiſe of danger alarms our quiet; yea, the very ſurmiſes we have of unknown powers, thoſe very unſhapely and inconſiſtent ſuſpitions affright us, becauſe we are ſo placed, that we are ever offered at by danger; the waves are always rolling towards us, and we can never be truly quiet, till we are reconciled to him, who ſays to theſe proud waters, Hither ſhall ye go, and no further.</p>
            <p>Reconcilement with God lyes in a moſt wiſe and ponderous method of things; for he being the higheſt reaſon, and not a force or power only, the pureſt Holineſs and Righteouſneſs, and not a meer irreſiſtable ſtrength, our ſafety ſtands in agreement with thoſe Attributes, according to which he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns every thing, and ſeeing he is alſo infinite in beneficence and Grace, we have the advantage of all expectations from that Grace, either as it is impreſſed upon our minds, together with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions we have of a God, or more
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:59784:106"/> clearly diſcovered in the Goſpel; the declarations of which are always ready to unite with thoſe ſecret intimations in mans Soul, conveyed thither for this very purpoſe.</p>
            <p>The fundamental peace of a man lyes in his conformities to God in Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Goodneſs, without which it is hardly poſſible for it ſo much as to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine its peace after cold conſideration of it, there being no overthrowing ſo deep a ſenſe, as conſcience hath of this; for it ariſes from the moſt intimate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions we have of God, as a Nature infinitely pure, and thoſe we have alſo of our own Souls, whoſe due perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and accompliſhment is a participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the divine Nature, or likeneſs; and therefore from the correlation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and the Soul, flows that pertinacious exaction of the Soul from it ſelf, that it be good and holy, that it may have peace with God.</p>
            <p>But becauſe the Soul finds ſo much diſorder and contrariety in it ſelf to that awful Law, ſo many tranſgreſſions againſt it, that cannot be undone; it can have no reſt here, but needs
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:59784:106"/> ſomething that may countervail that guilt within it. There can be none ſo convenient, ſo great and potent, as the pardoning mercy of God in Jeſus Chriſt, who by his obedience to death in our Nature, carries up the ſupreme forgiveneſs of God.</p>
            <p>Yet this not exhauſting that Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and perſwaſion of the Soul, that it muſt be inwardly good; it is moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary the Doctrine of pardon by a Saviour ſhould be filled with a ſpirit and influence of Holineſs, that this grace may not ſeem proſtituted as an indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to ſin.</p>
            <p>Thus the foundations of our peace ſtand upon the free Grace of God, and ſincerity of Holineſs, as an evidence we are within the compaſs of that Grace: To aſſure which, the very ſame Spirit of Holineſs, alone able to diffuſe the comforts of this peace, comes in and anoints the Soul with the Joy of it, till it enters into the full poſſeſſions of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which is the final acquittal from evil.</p>
            <p>Evil may in the mean time be uſed for chaſtiſement, and higher inticement
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:59784:107"/> to Holineſs, but loſes its ſting, when that Juſtice that armed it, is ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>Thus a man acting upon the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of his own mind, when he finds himſelf oppreſſed with evil, is led into the Doctrine of Chriſtianity; for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the hand-writing upon himſelf, he reads God the Author of affliction; hence flows the ſenſe of ſin, ſince God afflicts not without cauſe: ſenſe of ſin and the diſpleaſure of God upon it, makes it neceſſary to inquire after the Doctrine of pardon and repentance. Theſe are no where in their Oriency, but in the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt: The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of pardon and peace carry a man into expectations of good from God. This being not found here, the Soul is ſent to the promiſes of Eternal life, made known and brought to light by Chriſt. Theſe give joy in tribulations, and hope of the Glory of God. This crowns the Soul, and ſets it triumphant over all evil in the world.</p>
            <p>Leſs then this can give us no true ſenſe or conſtruction of the great miſeries of our condition, nor with reaſon cluck us out of them into ſo much as the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of laſting reſt and ſafety.</p>
            <pb n="165" facs="tcp:59784:107"/>
            <p> The Soul of man ſo buſie as it is, firſt to inquire the reaſons of its unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, then to find the remedies of it, hath great advantage of accepting that truth which tells it all that is within it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning theſe things, and explains them ſo far, that it finds it ſelf at the very ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ends of theſe wonders, and to have as much made known of them, as is to be known.</p>
            <p>Thus out of the eater comes forth meat and ſweetneſs, out of evil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered by the mind of man, either act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its own reaſon, and ſecuring it ſelf the beſt it can againſt what it cannot remove, or turning it ſelf upon thoſe Principles ingraffed within it, that lead it to the ſource and Antidotes of miſery: Both which convey it to the Diſcipline of Jeſus Chriſt, as the true relief of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane condition, and its infelicity.</p>

            </head>
            <p>LEt us now approach the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the more immediate powers of Judgment.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They give a notable rebuke and abatement to ſenſe, and the ſenſual tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; Judgments trouble all the air ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality hath to breathe in, and make it dark; they pour out their vial upon its Sun, and a night enſues, ſo that it every where meets terrour and diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which bring it low, and enfeeble it. Now this is that ſenſuality that over-grows at once the proper motions of a Soul and Conſcience, and that ſpiritual world, with which the converſes of a ſpirit moſt properly lye. When this is wind-bound, and brought to an ebb, either through the hand of God upon
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:59784:108"/> the body, the primary ſeat of it, or thoſe external objects that feed and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to it, immediately the mind that lay in a ſwoon, and oppreſſed, emerges, and riſes up. It hath its opportunity, and uſes its freedom; through the great clefts and rents the ſtrokes of God make in this vail and cloud, the Soul eſpies the ſpiritual world, the ſhadow of the material one removing off by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of theſe commotions cauſed by Judgments.</p>
            <p>The great accounts of mans ſin and impenitency lye in the deep plunges and immerſions of his Soul into ſenſe, and ſenſual things, wherein he grows immoderate above the beaſts, through the vigours of an immaterial and immortal Spirit diſſevered from its true objects and natural motions, and carried down this ſtream: From whence retaining all its own force, but miſguid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it grows extreamly foul, while it at once neglects heavenly and ſpiritual things for which it was made, boldly tranſgreſſes all rules of goodneſs, and cuts its way through every thing to its impure ſatisfactions.</p>
            <pb n="168" facs="tcp:59784:109"/>
            <p> The light that is true and pure, is kept from all approach to it, and its own native exerciſe is ſuppreſſed; whence it comes to paſs, that God and Eternal things are covered from it, and as it were wholly blotted out, it lives in the unclean pleaſures of the body, which have all the influence and ſway upon it.</p>
            <p>But awakened by the Judgments of God, the Soul inquires after its own world, and meets it every where; God having graciouſly diſſeminated it into every thing within it, and without it, even as the open eye in the day time, greets the light where ever it goes.</p>
            <p>That great deal of ſenſual noiſe and buſineſs, being made to ceaſe, the falſe light being put out, and the windows, out of which luſt looks, dammed up, the Soul hath nothing elſe to do; it finds leiſure then to do like it ſelf, and is even provoked to it by its own force, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it always upon action, and when it is taken off from that to which it is only inclaved, it returns upon its proper motion; when the noiſes of Chariots and their jumping wheels, the ſounds of muſick, the light of candles, as in the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:59784:109"/> overthrow of Cities, are removed, in that ſtilneſs Conſcience is heard; in that ſilence of fooliſh fires, purer rays ſhine upon the Soul: For the beams of truth, and the diſtinct voice of it fall every where, were there but an eye and ear to receive and take them in. On the other ſide, the capacities of the Soul are always fitted to them, and were they not importuned, and incumbred by other things, they would be continually open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to, and earneſtly expecting them. Heavenly light and knowledge, like God and his Providence, is both within by its intimate diffuſion of it ſelf, and without every thing in the world by its own unmeaſurableneſs, and ſo cannot be covered; but becauſe thoſe organs that are to obſerve, and work by it, are diſabled, and turned another way, and becauſe men uſe every art, and make all kind of vails and ſhuts between themſelves and this ſpiritual light, the Judgments of God make a colliſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the faculties of the Soul, upon which the ſparks hid within flye out, and there is a forced kind of light, in order to that which is more natural and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:59784:110"/> a great flame oft ariſing out of this little fire.</p>
            <p>Although if the heart of man were not ſo thick in its inſenſibleneſs of God, and the powers of it that ſhould tend towards him, afar off from him, there were no ſuch violence neceſſary in the caſe: But things being as they are, there can be no fairer opportunity preſented to man to recover himſelf out of the ſnare of ſenſual things, or the profound launches of his Soul into them, then theſe ſeverities of affliction, which bridle the appetite in himſelf, and render un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful, or remove out of his reach the very things he luſts after; for if the pain be in the body, the Soul is filled with ſo dolorous a reſentment from it, that nothing appears fair to it; when man is chaſtened with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with ſtrong pain, his Soul abhorreth bread, and his life dainty meats. If the Judgment of God lyes on the pleaſures of ſenſe without, it immediately enters within, through the famine that preſſes, or through the very anguiſh inflicted upon it by the contrariety of natural
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:59784:110"/> cauſes; ſo that either way, it is made to ſit alone and keep ſilence. In which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval ruſh in the thoughts of God, and the obedience we owe to him; a ſenſe that we are made for greater things; the excellency of peace with God, and likeneſs to him; our relation to Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: in all which lye the moſt potent ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to goodneſs, which when they meet upon an irregular and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed eſtate, fill the Soul with the ſorrow that works into repentance, and a zeal of recovering it ſelf to a better condition.</p>
            <p>For the inconvenience that ſenſe feels in theſe preſſures, when the goodneſs of God is retreated, and the hand of his diſpleaſure ſtretched out, is ſo great, that it enters into the very reaſon, and provokes that to inquire the cauſe; even as the delights of ſenſe diſtil upon the mind, and cloſe it up in a ſoft ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and in apprehenſiveneſs of it ſelf, and what is truly its intereſt, faſcina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with other pleaſures: In the mean time it exacts of it, all its ſagacity and vigour to be imployed in continuing and inlarging thoſe fruitions: So the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:59784:111"/> of the ſame ſenſe pierce into the Soul, and putting it into an agony, call it up to another kind of exerciſe, the conſideration of the complaints it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers.</p>
            <p>Now though while the bed was eaſie, it was content to lye down, and forget every thing; yet when it miſſes of this, and grows full of loſſes, and is ſet to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine how this comes to paſs, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees it returns like the Prodigal in want to it ſelf. Its firſt inquiries and determinations ſtay as long as they can upon natural cauſes; it undertakes and endeavours to ſolve things upon thoſe Principles: but being urged by the caſe it ſelf, and its own temper to ſearch fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is ſent from one thing to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, till within the inmoſt fold of things, it finds a divine Juſtice, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it is reſolved into a conſcience, and lays together the great obligations of repentance and humiliation.</p>
            <p>By this light a man hath quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſenſe of ſin, and the evil of it; thoſe actions he paſſed ſo favourably or care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly upon, have much a more ghaſtly and dreadful appearance. Thus God
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:59784:111"/> excites a man to take a juſt account, and make a righteous judgment of his own actions, and to call that into ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he never queſtioned before. It is meet to be ſaid unto God under chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I have done iniquity, but will of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend no more. That which I ſee not, teach thou me. He ſearches and tryes his ways, that he may turn to God.</p>
            <p>For Judgments carrying with them the moſt cloſe and ſenſible inſtructions of the diſpleaſure of God, convey alſo the quickeſt reaſons of ſelf-examination, of repentance, and change of a mans courſe, to thoſe who are neither ſunk down to a brutiſh or <hi>Pharaoh-like</hi> impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency, nor riſen up to the more hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick ſtate of one chuſing Holineſs for it ſelf, and not of love. For man having an affection of fear, it is impoſſible he ſhould not turn it upon that which is moſt dreadful, when it appears to him; or that that fear ſhould not excite him to the removal of the danger; the firſt of which is founded in that Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that every affection turns to the ſupreme object underſtood with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt intention; the ſecond in that of
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:59784:112"/> ſelf-preſervation: For the firſt, it is certain the wrath of God is moſt terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, it being moſt commanding, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues a man beyond the moſt formidable of evils, death, which is therefore ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the opinion of Nature it ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows all ſenſe of Being; now ſenſe of Being is the foundation of pleaſure and delight: but this keeps a man in the jaws of that ſecond death, which eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally ruminates upon him. Our Saviour ſpoke higheſt reaſon; Fear not them that kill the body, and have no more that they can do; but I will forewarn you whom ye ſhall fear, Fear him, that after he hath killed, hath power to caſt into hell: I ſay unto you, Fear him. For the removal of this danger, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing conſcience is more authoritative in then this, There can be no firm at onement with God, nor ſo much as expectation of good from him without repentance or reformation; it ever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing moſt unreaſonable to it, that God ſhould give any ear to him that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards iniquity in his heart.</p>
            <p>To conclude this; conſcience that is the moſt vigorous of all a mans powers,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:59784:112"/> being collected and congregated of the ſtrength of all, and acting upon thoſe Principles that every man knows to be the moſt concerning, if true; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of demonſtration for the truth of its grounds, hath this advantage, that they are deeply rivetted into the heart, ſo that though there may be a ſtupefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, yet there can be no obliteration. Againſt this ſtupefaction Judgments come, making legible thoſe Characters which at other times we diſſemble, and are as the fire to ſome ſort of writing, that makes apparent what was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore diſcerned.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XIV. <hi>Of Senſe of particular Sins effected by by Judgments.</hi>
            </head>
            <p n="2">2. UNder Judgments there is a ſenſe of particular ſins, which rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berated upon the Soul by it ſelf, thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged and inlivened by the preſence of a divine Juſtice aſſiſting it, is of all things moſt aſtoniſhing, proſtrates the Soul, and ſubmits it to any terms of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in hope of Grace.</p>
            <pb n="176" facs="tcp:59784:113"/>
            <p> A man thus affected, feels the deadly ſtroke in that ſtrength of his Soul, that is to bear him up in every infirmity (that is) the ſpirit of a man, which when it is wounded, what can uphold it, that it ſelf carried all?</p>
            <p>This is the power that poiſes every evil, and judges of the ſpring from which it riſes, the extent of its virtue, the effects and ends it is to reach: And then compares with the evil the ſtrength that is neceſſary to oppoſe it, the means of prevention, the proper allays in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during it, if it cannot be avoided, the efficacies of removal; according to all which, that native courage and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion keeps it ſelf upright, and ſinks not under the evil. But what can it do? when the evil is ſo great, that there is no match between all that the Soul can find either to protect or reſcue it, and that this very ſpirit of it falls ſplit, as with a ſhaft of Thunder, is ſo diſſolved and melted, that it is ready to take any new ſhape, having no further conſiſtency in that, formerly its own.</p>
            <p>Now it is moſt evident, an infinite wrath is too great for allay or remedy,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:59784:113"/> too conſtant for removal; all valour and reſolution againſt an infinite evil, is firſt madneſs and fooliſh hardineſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it comes, and when it is felt, either ſoftens into extream deſpondency, or rages into deſpair.</p>
            <p>That which breaks the ſpirit of a man thus, is not yet ſimply the evil, or the infiniteneſs of it, but its failure in that which is its ſtrength, <hi>viz.</hi> innocency and freedom from guilt; without which it can never be truly great, and when it finds the want of this, it ſinks oppreſſed with its own weight.</p>
            <p>Judgments are like the Rack to the Soul, which work it to unboſom it ſelf within it ſelf, as men are tortured in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the confeſſions that they would elſe moſt earneſtly have ſuppreſſed. <hi>Joſephs</hi> brethren at ſuch a time confeſſed among themſelves the ſin they had ſo long hid from their own Souls as well as others.</p>
            <p>Thus riſe up particular ſins, leading into the univerſal foulneſs and obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the whole ſtate, ſo that if a man ſhould offer to retire into himſelf, he feels he is purſued into his very heart, and yet finds no Sanctuary there, when
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:59784:114"/> he would be quiet in his innocency, and that is gone; this is the profoundeſt abaſement of a man.</p>
            <p>Thus God girds us with our ſins, and fills our bowels with our guilt, and even ſoaks our bones with our wickedneſs, as with oyl, till all we endure is no leſs our own Juſtice upon our ſelves then Gods.</p>
            <p>This begets in a man earneſteſt deſires of mercy from him, without whom we cannot be merciful to our ſelves: This makes repentance and returns to good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as neceſſary to the Soul for its peace with it ſelf, as it is for its peace with God.</p>
            <p>For all the ſentences of God, when ever they come into execution, propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate themſelves, and beget the very ſame in the ſinner himſelf; who if he could but comfort himſelf with his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, would with far more eaſe ſuffer from a power above him, though injuſt to him.</p>
            <p>A virtuous man conſcious of nothing, but rectitude and ſincerity, ſtands un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaken in that, and values his untainted mind above the Tyrants ſpotted great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, however he lye at the power of it.
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:59784:114"/> But whither ſhould he flye, that feels ſo great a ſeverity from himſelf, but out of himſelf into the arms of mercy, and to the re-innocency of repentance?</p>
            <p>Into the arms of that mercy which is ſuperior to the natural compaſſion of a man to himſelf, and to that re-innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of repentance, the only refuge of the Soul when vexed, and purſued with its guilt, and the ſelf-abhorrencies ſpringing from it, which make it intolerably wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of its own thoughts, and retorted looks upon its ſtate.</p>
            <p>That ſupreme Goodneſs, that firſt drives a man out of his ſins by theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior perplexities into the neceſſities of repentance (for who can endure himſelf in that foulneſs his eye is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually upon?) hath alſo prepared the ſame repentance to be the pleaſant and conſolatory retirement of it, in which it returns into a reconciliation with it ſelf, even as with God through Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

            </head>
            <p n="3">3. ALL anguiſhes of the Soul, either from its outward trouble, or thoſe internal afflictions from the ſenſe of ſin, do moſt naturally run out into Prayer and addreſs to God. Whoſo gives them not that vent, reſtrains and forcibly impriſons ſo free and inclinable a motion of his own Soul. Theſe deſires towards God and his mercy, when they are cloiſtered in ſullen and irreligious breaſts, like ſtrong liquors confined againſt their will, or like the earneſt winds that cannot endure their priſon, find ſome out-let to themſelves, ſo that ſometimes unawares, ſomtimes extorted invocations of higheſt goodneſs, have come from them who have ſtudiouſly compreſſed thoſe their moſt genuine ſentiments; but not only from the truly humble and religious breaſt, but even from unprejudiced Nature they have much a greater liberty, and take their free courſe. Now no mans Soul
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:59784:115"/> goes out to God for relief in miſery, but it hath ſome conſiderations of thoſe great Principles that make ſuch a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reaſonable, and of ſuch attendants of theſe deſires that may make the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to God decent and honourable: All which concenter in the neceſſary change of the heart and life. If he that wrought a miracle in Chriſts Name could not lightly ſpeak evil of him, with how great an impropriety doth that man approach God and his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, who intends a continued defiance to him by his ſins? How doth he bran down that ſenſe of divine mercy leading to repentance, the conſideration of which gives him leave to hope well from God?</p>
            <p>This then ſhews the advantage of affliction, in which theſe motions of the Soul to God are as natural as the very deſires of relief ſimply conſidered; all are ready to viſit God in affliction, and to pour out a prayer when his chaſtning is upon them. God makes no doubt of a very bad ſort of men, that in their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction they will ſeek him early: It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the higheſt act of impenitency <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi>

The powers of mens Souls are never in a more fading con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, nor their ſins in greater violence then when they call not upon God, nor ſtir up themſelves to take hold of him.</p>

            <p>THis Diſcourſe of the efficacies of Judgment, we have ſo placed, that it is moſt applicable to particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; but when they have a due effect there, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hey do from ſingle breaſts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire into a general air, eſpecially when they affect the hearts of perſonages that are of power and example, from them they reſult upon whole bodies of people, and give at leaſt ſome tincture to the ſtate of times, that they become more ſober, and of a better inclination. For there is apparently a Genius and
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:59784:116"/> temper of an Age, even as there is of perſons, and a common conſtitution of a Nation, as of one man, which is alſo capable of ſuch kind of alterations in Morality, as in ſingle men, which are produced by the Cardinal changes that fall out in and upon them.</p>
            <p>Yet ſeeing no man can determine what this will be (that is) whether the Age he lives in will be reformed by Judgments, when it hath ſo far corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as to make it ſelf the ſeat of them: ſeeing theſe general amendments grow not upon private men, nor ſo much as upon leſſer fraternities, except as they meet in greater incorporations, or ſpring from the higheſt branches of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality, which as in the tree inverted, are indeed the roots of all publick aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciations, and moſt often of their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
            <p>That being then incertain to us that is out of our power, it is good for every man to look well to the ſtate of his own Soul; that if he find not any exemption from the common evil, yet he may be inrolled in eternal mercies, which is a Cabinet always removed from the poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:59784:117"/> of danger: and indeed theſe powerful operations of Grace are moſt deſigned to the eternal happineſs of man, even when they paſs through theſe auſterer methods, wherein God is very good; for if he takes the preſent ſtate, and moulds it any way for our everlaſting peace and life, it is an act of infinite mercy. All true goodneſs hath its preſent uſe in this world; it honours God, makes the beſt compoſure of the Soul, offers a bleſſing to the world now; but it doth not like the creatures of time, determine it ſelf here: It doth not as thoſe faint things breathe out and dye, but ſhines a light in the world, keeping the moſt perverſe and crooked generation from utter darkneſs, and is at laſt tranſlated from hence to a higher Orbe of Glory and eternal luſtre, but never ſuffers extinction.</p>
            <p>No man then loſes by his reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or the good effect of evil, though through general obſtinacy in wicked ways, the Judgment goes on, and he dyes in the common calamity; for to fit men for enjoyment of proſperity here, is but a contingent end of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:59784:117"/> eternal bleſſedneſs is only certain to it.</p>
            <p>While good men are thus provided for, the refractorineſs of the Age or other particular perſons, is no diſproof of the uſefulneſs of Judgments, any more then that many dye under the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of Phyſick, is an argument againſt ſo worthy a Science. When men under the hand of God have nothing worthy repentance riſing in them, 'tis deadly. As when a Phyſitian purges, yet the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper continues, and the blood is ſtill impure after frequent Phlebotomy; for it argues all is diſcuſt, the whole maſs is corrupted, and nothing to be purged, but what is it ſelf; for impurity ſtill ſwims up after all evacuations. God is weary of ſtriking impenitents in order to a cure; they muſt dye as thoſe in whom Nature hath no reſiſtance to make againſt the prevailing diſtemper; the whole head is ſick, and the whole heart faint, and thoſe powers periſhed, that ſhould be aided by medicine: The principles of recovery that are as the handles by which God apprehends the Soul, are loſt by great obdur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

            <head>CHAP. XVII. <hi>An Inquiry into the Freedom of God in his diſtribution of Judgments; with a ſolution of doubts concerning it.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>WE have thus far endeavoured to ſpeak the reaſon of Scripture, touching the Judgments of God, which are all holy, juſt, and good, faithful to his own Glory, and the true intereſt of the world. There remains nothing within our preſent intention, that may either eſtabliſh, or clear from the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections raiſed againſt it, this grand Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, That all the evils we endure are righteous Judgments of God; but to reconcile with it the liberty and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitration God uſes in over-looking and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:59784:118"/> paſſing by ſome times and perſons that are free from thoſe ſtrokes, upon which yet the main reaſons of Judgments we have aſſigned, are concurrent.</p>
            <p>This is firſt to be reſolved into the uncontrollable Counſel of God, who giveth no ſuch account of his matters; but that his paths are ſtill hid in the Sea, and his foot-ſteps in the great wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. This we know, he is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works, what he does is therefore to conclude our thoughts; who being but upon the ſkirts and borders of knowledge, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand much more what is fit to be done, by what we ſee him do, then by our own conjectures, which if not ſo bounded, are vain, and rove incertainly in the wild of things. His actions are the great marks by which our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings are to be guided, that they may not dangerouſly miſcarry. If then we obſerve a void place of Judgments, let us rebuke our own apprehenſions (when we take upon us to think it fit, Juſtice ſhould there have planted it ſelf) with the acknowledges of the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion it hath over all times and perſons;
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:59784:119"/> when we ſee its diſplays in the world, we may then underſtand God is giving ſome preſent check to ſin, and its graſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant impurity, that carries ſuch effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies along with it, as ſeem meet to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>But though we thus aſcribe greatneſs to God, yet may we ſecondarily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve thoſe moments of ſatisfaction we receive out of his Word, and the reaſon of it, which are enough to anſwer any ſcruples concerning the non-appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his Juſtice in a ſeaſon, when it ſeems requiſite it ſhould be ſeen, and to free us out of that maze of doubts that falls in therewith, <hi>viz.</hi> the inequality of his dealings either with good men, compared with evil men, or towards good and evil men, compared each ſort among themſelves; for when either the evil paſs peaceably through, and out of the world, and feel no bands in their death; but good men have wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of a full cup wrung out unto them; or when one good man hath the candle of God ſhining in his Tabernacle, waſhes his ſteps in butter, and hath the Rock pouring out oyl to him; and
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:59784:119"/> another, though fearing God, eats in darkneſs all his days, diſconſolate either with publick or private calamities: or laſtly when one evil man fares wel in the common proſperity, and another of the ſame ſtamp is covered with a cloud all his days, either in the general adverſity or his particular infelicity; there is an appearance of partiality: and ſeeing all of both qualities arrive each at their own ends, any ſolution taken from thoſe ends ſeems inſufficient. All theſe are ſo many ſcandals to this Doctrine, which yet true reaſon of Scripture plentifully removes. There is enough too to reſolve us, how the diſadvantage of living out of the diſcipline of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is recompenſed to thoſe, who poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly had they lived under it, would have repented in ſack-cloth and aſhes.</p>
            <p>All theſe, I ſay, to him who reverences Gods Ark, is wiſely converſant in the things revealed, that pertain to us, and repines not that the dark waters and thick clouds of the sky are Gods Pavillion; are ſo far unridled, that he finds the benefit of that promiſe; The
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:59784:120"/> humble he will guide in Judgment, and the meek he will teach his way: the ſecret of the Lord is communicated with them that fear him; for he leads them into more, who expect his admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, then they can obtain, who cutting their way to themſelves, raviſh the cloud of an empty imagination; when they moſt pleaſe themſelves with what they think they have found out and comprehended. The Scriptures ſpeak wiſdom, but not the wiſdom of this world, which is brought to nought; not that which he towres into, who is vainly pufft up with his fleſhly mind; but that which is to ſobriety: let us then meaſure by the line of it to theſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going thoughts, to which it reaches, ſo as to bring them into ſubjection.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to the Juſtice of God it can have no injury, becauſe there is an Eternal Judgment, ſo high and ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, that it doth infinitely honour, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie, and recompenſe whatever Juſtice can ſeem to ſuffer. Nothing is under a neceſſity to ſhew it ſelf, but that which is confined to ſuch a moment; and if it loſes that, lyes hid for ever. Things
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:59784:120"/> which are poor, that have only an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and not a retired treaſure, are in haſte to be known; ſmall revenges are haſtily executed, but <hi>nullum tempus occurrit Regi.</hi> The deep waters run ſilently, and what hath Eternity to give it room and ſpace, ſlumbers not, though it make no preſent noiſe; God hath the higheſt reaſons of his patience, the perfect ſtrength of his Being, and the vaſtneſs of everlaſting Ages to explain himſelf and his diſpleaſure in. All opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of men againſt him and his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciary Providence, vaniſh like a dream when he appears, for his coming con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains belief, commands full aſſent, and nothing contrary dares then be ſeen; nor can it be traced, but in that horrour and condemned diſappointment, to which it hath betrayed the maſters of it.</p>
            <p>The apprehenſions that have footing only in time, are not to be valued; for time it ſelf is ſo little and inconſiderable a thing, that though it is greater or leſs, when it is meaſured by its own line; yet it is but the duſt of the ballance, the drop of the Bucket, nothing, &amp; leſs then
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:59784:121"/> nothing when it is ſet by Eternity; when any immortal Being, eſpecially the prime Being, who only hath immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, hath the graſping of it, it is ſqueezed to nothing: while it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it ſelf, judged by its own Rules, and the creatures of it, it is ſomewhat; but to God the Grandeur and pride of it a thouſand years are but as yeſterday when it is paſt, and as a watch in the night; the contempt God and his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice endure from it, as ſoon as ever it ſinks into Eternity, are as if they had never been; one glance of that Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment immediately conſumes it.</p>
            <p>This conſideration doth alſo abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly remove the inequalities of time, if we ſuppoſe them never ſo great, and level good men among themſelves, and bad men among themſelves; and ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely diſtinguiſhes good and bad one from another, that there remain no poſſible remembrances of the ſtate of this world, nor any thing that ſhould call in queſtion, or diminiſh ought from the clearneſs of Gods dealing. Eternal rewards and puniſhments ſwallow up all diſtinctions of time, which hereupon
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:59784:121"/> become no more then imagination or opinion, when true Judgment takes place; or then thought and fancy, when knowledge and reality enter; the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and happineſſes, the torment and complaint of it are all gone; all that is great in time is the manner and temper of an immortal Spirit in and upon it, which is an inchaſement of Eternity into it, and makes it valuable for the ordinableneſs of it to an everlaſting condition of things: all of it elſe is but like infancy and child-hood, compared with manly eſtate; that is vanity and folly: whatever puerile age ſeems to it ſelf, it is known to have nothing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy in it, but the beginnings and dawns of that mind, which education im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves, and ripens to a ſtrength in elder years, for which it is formed: The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it hath of ſeverer Judgment, detracts nothing from the ſolidity and dignity of true reaſon, but is imputed to its ſillineſs and imperfection; the pleaſures of it are condemned, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy a man. The very ſame Soul cenſures, and even deſpiſes it ſelf in its childiſh eſtimations, diſcourſes and
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:59784:122"/> actions, when it feels it ſelf man, and remembers them not but with diſlike or compaſſionate ſcorn. If after-time then blots out the things fore-going with ſo ſtrange an oblivion; if manhood doth ſo efface paſt child-hood, and death yet expunges much more then theſe, how exceedingly more doth another world wipe out all things pertaining to this? Moralities only remaining, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted through all without loſs; from whence accrues to good men greater glory through their ſufferings, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of torment to the evil from their pleaſures, with which they are upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hereafter; and very probably each of theſe ariſing to both ſorts, proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the difference they have met with here in the world.</p>
            <p>Further, different preſences of God, and the conſolations of his Spirit, may be a preſent reward to good men in the worſt times; ſervice of God, even to a kind of Martyrdom, ſpeedier tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Heaven, greater degrees of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and bleſſed Immortality, are much better to them then an eaſe and quiet, that muſt within ſuch a number
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:59784:122"/> of years expire however: Even as ſtings of conſcience, and longer heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up guilt and wrath, may make it leſs tolerable for evil men, who have lived in proſperous times, then for others of the ſame kind, who have been preſerved from ſo much ſin, and awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſome ſenſe of God by adverſity; their preſent trouble thus leſſening an eternal puniſhment, except to thoſe who have been brawned to a greater contempt of God, and hardned in the fire againſt him, whoſe caſe deſerves no conſideration.</p>
            <p>From all which we ſee, there is no ſuch neceſſity upon God to puniſh now, nor any ſo complainable inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in his diſtributions to good and bad men. For when either of theſe ranks of men know themſelves in that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable ſtate, they will reflect upon nothing in time, but as it hath paid ſomething to Eternity, and conveyed thither what remains and abides. If then any thing aggrandizes that happineſs, or aſſwages that miſery, however it hath been reſented with grief and deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here, it is then put on as a crown,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:59784:123"/> or applyed as a Lenitive to pain; but that which is bleſſed with no additta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Glory, is laid aſide as worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, how pleaſant ſoever in the world; and that which inflames torment, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways bewailed, though it was carried as a priviledge here. All things elſe loſe themſelves more perfectly in that ſtate, then whatever we can imagine moſt trivial here, when it is utterly out of date, and ſucceeded by a contrary, however it preſumed before in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of its flouriſh.</p>
            <p>With this Judgment then God infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely aſſoils his Juſtice, from the ſcoffes of men that ſay, When is the promiſe of his coming? from the ſenſuality of men that put the evil day far from them: with this he divides the world, that all may diſcern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that feareth and ſerveth God, and the prophane and him that ſerveth him not. By this he adjuſts to every of both theſe their due portion, honour to whom honour, ſtripes to whom ſtripes, with their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and number; however they lye huddled now, and the beſt oft-times in
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:59784:123"/> the darkeſt place. And this Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is plentifully declared to the world, that every one may make a right uſe of it, in giving Glory to God, and prejudging things not againſt, but with that day. If any do otherwiſe, he that ſits in the Heaven obſerves their folly, and laughs at it: For he ſeeth that this day is coming, as he that is ſure of his revenge upon a contumacious ingrate, firſt in compaſſion warns him, and that rejected with a ſecret deriſion, obſerves him in his fooliſh boldneſs, and with a contented patience bears his continued affronts; expecting quietly the ſeaſon of his puniſhment: or as a wiſe man that knows his own grounds in a point of truth, tranquilly reſts upon them, and bears with a merciful diſdain the clamour of a conceited Opinioniſt; ſo God having ſetled things with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable Righteouſneſs, and a patience alſo, that yet carries dread with it, ſays to thoſe that will not believe ſuch a Judgment, He that is filthy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous, let him be ſo ſtill.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whereas God may ſeem by the ſuſpenſion of his Judgments, careleſs of
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:59784:124"/> that purgation of the world by their preſent execution, let us obſerve what other proviſions his Holineſs, Wiſdom, and Goodneſs have made herein.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Eternal Sacrifice of Jeſus Chriſt, that in one act of offering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf gives that perpetual glory to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, that doth not only countervail, but infinitely preponderate and effect more then thoſe daily repeated Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, or thoſe more ſolemn ones; to which yet the reaſon of all the world hath ever made recourſe for luſtration of themſelves.</p>
            <p>The life and actions of our Bleſſed Saviour, of ſuch incomparable innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy &amp; divine perfection, hath ſet Holineſs at ſuch an elevation, that no depreſſion of it by the iniquities of men, are at all comparable with the exaltations of it in him. He as our <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> hath con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tracted upon himſelf all our guilt, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> being made a curſe for us, hath devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our curſe, and paid an uttermoſt compenſation to punitive Juſtice. He by a moſt Chryſtalline purity reſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in our Nature, hath diſcovered the beauties of Holineſs beyond all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:59784:124"/> obſcurations of ours, the efficacies of which his mediatory negotiation are much clearer in Heaven, the proper Region; whither he carried his merit to be ſeated in an unintermitted Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and whence he pours down the benefits of it upon Earth.</p>
            <p>As God therefore is well pleaſed, and always ſmells a ſavour of reſt in Jeſus Chriſt, upon which he cannot only ſtay his ſeverity but bleſs the world without injury to his Juſtice, or diſhonour to his Holineſs; ſo is the world it ſelf ſeaſoned by ſo great a Sanctity, &amp; perfumed with the odour of it. This indeed eminently is the ſafety of them that believe, but extends it ſelf to all, for he is the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of all, though eſpecially of them that believe; and taſted death for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man: which therefore avails for the reprieve of thoſe, whom yet it doth not protect from condemnation.</p>
            <p>That which relieves good men from eternal ſufferings due to ſin, with the perfect atonement of Juſtice and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, can without the offence of thoſe Attributes continue under patience and long-ſuffering thoſe, that at the laſt,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:59784:125"/> through impenitency, pay themſelves to the glory of vengeance in the day of wrath.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Under the wing of this Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood lye the humiliations, obediences, and interceſſions of gracious men, who are alſo the Prieſts of the world, and obtain pardon upon Earth in the virtue of the Mediator in Heaven. They who giving God no reſt day or night, prevail for mercy, and live the Horſemen and Chariots of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the great ſecurity and defence of their Country, of which when any City or Nation is naked, they are immediately the prey of Juſtice; their Righteouſneſs being from the Grace of God, a ſalt that preſerves their time from putrefaction. To this we may ſubjoyn the happineſs of ſome times, that are fuller of the days of the Son of Man (that is) have clearer effuſions of the Goſpel and Divine Truth upon the world; which carrying a ſway upon the conſciences of men, give univerſal eſtimation to God and his ways, and have a train of moral Virtues attendant; which may make general Judgments leſs neceſſary vindications of contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:59784:125"/> ſins, and may at leaſt delay Judgments till after-times. Examples of which we obſerve in Sacred Story.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, we have already ſaid, inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Judgment do not breathe out themſelves in the preſent moments, nor ſo much as in the preſent Age; but derive themſelves upon following time, and are accepted for ſuch a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod: Like the great expiation, that in one day purged the whole year. In all times there are yet foot-ſteps of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though in more private and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired walks that continually fall out, like thoſe Sacrifices that were daily of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, though of leſs ſolemnity, and thoſe that were appointed in particular caſes of a more ordinary occurrence.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If it ſeem the diſadvantage of any time, that it is not diſciplined by theſe chaſtiſements; we muſt know, that Judgments are not equal with thoſe Ordinances of God, or like his Word, that have in their inſtitution an immediate accommodation to ſuch ends; but are uſeful through the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening inſtruction of that Law that God teaches out of, when he chaſtiſes; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:59784:126"/> which men dye under thoſe ſtrokes unreformed. Other courſes of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence have alſo their witneſs of God, and peculiar fitneſſes to be managed by his truth to the ends of converſion and repentance; for thither the patience and goodneſs of God lead, att<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mpered to the more ingenuous Elements of mans Soul, that are touched with the magnetiſms of love: Even as Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments take eare of thoſe that are moved by fear, and therefore have their ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in the more corrupted parts of degenerate Nature.</p>
            <p>To ſum all: Suſpenſion of Judgments is a beautiful place in the contexture of Providence, and illuſtrates that Being to us, whom we know in the various diſcoveries of himſelf, but chiefly in his goodneſs; which yet would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, if he did not thus adminiſter things: His patience and long-ſuffering in which he ſo much delights, would be covered; the loving kindneſs he exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes in the Earth, and the tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies wherewith he fills it, would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, ſo that his preſent Government would want that conſiderable piece of
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:59784:126"/> honour, which it eſpecially chuſeth and prefers it: For his mercy rejoyceth againſt Judgment, and accordingly he hath taken care theſe kinder Attributes ſhould have faireſt impreſſions on mans Soul, and be the cleareſt teſtimonies of him; whereas Judgment being his ſtrange act, hath leſſer prints of it on our hearts, and raiſes doubts concerning him. No man wonders, or is in amaze at the goodneſs and benignity of God, whenever he hears it; but is ſtartled at his ſeverity, and calls for his ſaddeſt thoughts to reſolve it into the ſinful and guilty ſtate of man.</p>
            <p>Without this gracious Manu-tenency there could be no condition of things; Kingdoms and Empires could grow up to no flouriſh, nor ſettle in any great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; the proſperity of them, which is ſo great a glory of Providence, were an impoſſibility; the whole Scene would repreſent nothing but Judgments, till all run into an univerſal deſolation, and many of the moſt remarked methods of Judgment it ſelf loſt; moſt of the freer motions of mans will had been conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and ſhut up by them which afford
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:59784:127"/> ſo large a ground to Providences both of Mercy and Judgment. God as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his Juſtice eſſayed the uſe of an univerſal deſtruction in the Flood of <hi>Noah,</hi> when he repented he had made man, as if he had done a diſhonour to his own Holineſs, in bringing forth a Nature that ſhould defile it ſelf, and all it touched: and that he might relieve againſt a miſchief as it were unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and right himſelf, makes haſte to deſtroy that degenerate Nature, with the parts of the Creation moſt uſed and corrupted by it.</p>
            <p>But then, as if he diſallowed the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, determines againſt it for the future, and reſtores the ſeeds of mankind he had to that purpoſe preſerved, to much of their former condition, and renews the Charter of their Dominion over the Creatures.</p>
            <p>This piece of Sacred Hiſtory repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to us in a Land-ſkip (thus flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take our apprehenſions) this truth, That God with a Salve to that Holineſs (in honour to which he delivered things to ſo great a ruine) would now conſerve the world under his patience
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:59784:127"/> and long-ſuffering; and not roll it up any more in an univerſal devaſtation, till that greateſt and laſt of Judgments, in which he will abſolve the whole Scheme of his Juſtice, and fill up what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſeems wanting in it now.</p>

            <p>BEſides the freedom the ſupreme Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of the world uſes, in fixing his Judgments upon ſome parts of time, and not upon others; there are alſo the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious kinds and meaſures of his debates, and the Criſis of them, when they end in deſtruction; which to obſerve, may much further inlarge our thoughts in this Contemplation, and the Duty of it.</p>
            <p>As then in Creation God hath form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vaſt bodies of the ſame kind, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we ſee a great deal of one thing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, by which he teaches us that immenſe power that never ſpends it ſelf; ſo hath he alſo multiformed his
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:59784:128"/> productions into an endleſs variety, that we may behold that infinity of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, that is not tyed to one ſhape of things.</p>
            <p>Thus his Judgments are ſometimes caſt into one Element, or Globe of fire, ſwelling like the huge mountains, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering all like a great Deep; ſuch were thoſe on <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> on the old world; teaching us Juſtice is not poor in any of its revenges: Again it uſes ſeveral leſſer, and diverſe evils, that we may know every thing is ready to its purpoſes of wrath, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſtings of puniſhment againſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
            <p>Both theſe ſometimes are ſingle, made up intire in themſelves, ſolitary Wars, Plagues, Famines; at other times they meet together in one great Configura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and are conſtellated. Laſtly, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they riſe up to their height, as it were in an inſtant; at other times they are ordered into a train and ſucceſſion: and this being the moſt ordinary Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Judgments, and with which we of this Nation have been much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, let us reflect more freely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
            <pb n="207" facs="tcp:59784:128"/>
            <p> At ſuch a time the hand of God keeps upon the Table, and his opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are like ſeveral limbs of a body, that are drawn one after another, and then the whole ſeen; or like a ſuit of Hangings wrought by their pieces, and then placed together, or unfolded by degrees, and the whole at laſt preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; or like an excellent Diſcourſe that paſſes out of the mind in ſingle ſheets, and then meets in the intire Work; or like the Creation, that by the ſteps of ſix days came to its Sabbath.</p>
            <p>Thus Gods procedure upon <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was by a gradation of Judgment, that compleated its figure in a ſucceſſion. The Angel in the Revelation proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a woe to the world, becauſe of the Angels yet to ſound: and one woe made haſte, that another to come quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly might have place. As <hi>Ezekiels</hi> wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, they riſe higher and higher, till they are a River not to be paſſed over. <hi>Noahs</hi> Flood prevailed by degrees, till every thing periſhed, that had not an Ark for its ſafety.</p>
            <p>By all theſe God ſhews himſelf; he weighs the hills in ſeales, and the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:59784:129"/> in a ballance: he makes one Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo great, as to fill the Earth with it ſelf. For what can more ſpeak his immenſity, He comprehends the duſt of the Earth in a meaſure, that is, he imploys little things to great purpoſes. The duſt that is eaſily ſcattered, when divided, is yet great and conſiderable, when gathered to a proportion. Out of the mouth of Babes and ſucklings thou haſt perfected praiſe, that thou mighteſt ſtill the enemy and the aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Judgments ſmall in themſelves, yet gathering to one another, are able to give a final determination to the ſum of affairs.</p>
            <p>By a ſucceſſion in Judgments he makes a fairer impreſſion of himſelf, which is better done by a leaſurely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding and continuation of his hand, like the rain that diſtils, and enters deeper then the ſudden ſtorms that haſte away. Slay them not, leſt my people forget: conſume them in wrath. God lodges himſelf in mens Souls when they are ſtill under his rod, whereas a nine days wonder ſwallows up a ſudden execution. Hereby he teaches, as in his
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:59784:129"/> Word, a line here and there, here a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and there a little. Theſe gradual motions are eſſays of mans repentance, leſſer ſtrokes, being as warnings to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent greater; God moves the Pillars of a Nation firſt, that the concuſſion felt, may admoniſh their weakneſs, when his angry touch is upon them, and every man from his place ſeek reſettlement in his favour: For the words of God find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo little regard, he thinks fit to give them an Emphaſis by his Rod, and the accent is ſtill deeper, that it may take the more place; or if men are incorrigible, and God reſolve to ſettle upon any Age, and make it the Generation of his wrath, he chains into a ſeries the acts of his indignation: It being rarer, that he deſtroys at once as <hi>Sodom,</hi> upon which no hand had room or ſpace to ſtay; but Judgments in their ſeveral courſes come on into the Battle, and one begins where the laſt ended, the Locuſt eating what the Palmer-worm left.</p>
            <p>Yet which way ſoever things fall out at laſt, God juſtifies his goodneſs, and that Philanthropy wherewith he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns humane affairs, by the pauſes he
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:59784:130"/> makes: For like thoſe averſations of his Glory, from the Temple by degrees in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> that the Jews moved by them might beſeech his return, ere he quite left them, they ſhew his willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to have the occaſion to retreat.</p>
            <p>Even <hi>Sodom</hi> it ſelf had the Avant-carrier of ſo great an overthrow, by the leſſer it ſuffered in the combination of the Kings againſt it; wherein God juſtifies himſelf, that he deſires not the death of ſinners, but that they ſhould turn from iniquity and live.</p>

            </head>
            <p>THe greateſt Criſis of Judgment is yet to be conſidered in all the courſe of it (that is) when it is to ceaſe in deſtruction; when God begins, and alſo makes ſuch an end, that affliction riſes not up the ſecond time; from which proceed thoſe reſolved changes of the world, emptied out of one veſſel into another; which by ſingle Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:59784:130"/> are only ſhaken, and time is ſet upon other Epoches that are to it like new hinges of motion; as in general from theſe variations it receives its cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Needle-work: In ſome parts of it, Judgments and mercies lye intermin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled: others beautiful with mercies only; and laſtly, ſome wholly dark and ſad with Judgments.</p>
            <p>This Character of Judgments ending in Ruine, is moſt diligently to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and may be diſcerned either by the Judgments themſelves, or the ſigns of the times upon which they fall.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In themſelves they are remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for then they are preceded by thoſe more then ordinary admonitions, from the diſturbed Courſe of Nature, which God hath made as well the Trumpet as the Inſtrument of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Signs in the Sun, and Moon, and Stars, Earthquakes, the Sea and the Waves roaring, the Powers of Heaven ſhaking, gave an Allarm to <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> deſtruction.</p>
            <p>Theſe indications of a common Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity are often ſtrangely inſinuated into the rational Creatures alſo, cauſing
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:59784:131"/> diſtreſs of Nations, perplexity, mens hearts failing for fear; there being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known motions, and diſcompoſures of mens ſpirits, whereof no account can be aſſigned, but they are the looſning of that Bridle God keeps upon all things, before he lays the ruins on their necks, and gives judiciary ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations to them. Theſe God uſually ſets as Introductions to great Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as Prefaces to huge Volumes, as Portals to great Edifices, or like the muſters of the Clouds, and trepidations of the Air before a Tempeſt, or the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed motions of diſperſed Soldiers, gathering into a body or arms before a Battle: he ſends theſe, as <hi>Elias</hi> before the great and terrible Day of the Lord, giving hereby a ſtate and pomp to thoſe monumentous Judgments, the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of which yield a natural elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to the Prophets, taken imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from things (for pomp and ſtate are the eloquence of things, and moſt eaſily paſs into words.) This is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcoverable, when Judgments tread on the heels of one another. For God doth not many things in vain, but
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:59784:131"/> intends to reach ſome height; when he is not quiet with the world, but impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes and ſollicites it to a ſenſe; when he ſpeaks once and twice, he intends ſomething great and conſiderable; for he doth not fight as one that beateth the air, but having entred into particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, at laſt ſums up all in a perfect ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. In <hi>Amos,</hi> when Judgments hung together in ſo long a line, at laſt he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, Therefore I will do this unto thee: Then leſſer Judgments are but the beginnings of ſorrows.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, when God doth ſtrange things without precedent, things that men will not believe, though they were told them, unuſual not only in the common courſe of Providence, which is very ſmooth, but ſtrange even in his ſtrange paths of Judgment, as it is ſaid of the Plagues of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the like were not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, nor after them any ſuch: God doth not reverſe what he hath ſetled by ſo great Wiſdom and Counſel, with ſo high a hand, but when he deſigns greateſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In regard of the times upon which Judgments fall, this Criſis, is then to be feared.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:59784:132"/> 1. When the Age we live in ſeems the drain &amp; ſink of the ſins, and evils of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, where they ſettle and grow to a head. One Age rolls down upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſinks into the bottom of time, ſo wickedneſs ſhoves it ſelf on, and reſts upon a center. Of this Generation ſhall be required all the blood that was ſhed from righteous <hi>Abel</hi> to <hi>Zacharias.</hi> The iniquity of the <hi>Amorites</hi> grows full, which had been ſome Ages in filling; the Ephah is crowned, and the talent of Lead cloſes it, and by wings it is haſted to its own Baſe, that is deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When we ſee people incorrigible, and inſenſible of Gods hand, keeping their Figure; it is much to be feared Judgments have ſtill more to do to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh their own: when things are in a conteſt, they continue to conflict one with another, till one of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts its own mode and ſtation. This cannot fall on an Almighty Juſtice; for in ſuch encounters great things cruſh little ones, till they can no longer main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain reſiſtance; and weak things that have a wiſe inſtinct or reaſon, ſhift
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:59784:132"/> themſelves every way to avoid the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. A broken ſpirit, a melted heart run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning out of its former ſhape, ceaſe the controverſie betwixt God and Man: but <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart hardned as the Adamant and ſteel, held Judgment play till it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed it ſelf into that abſolute portraicture we read in his Hiſtory.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Injuries done to the Truth and Goſpel of God, are ſad forebodes of ruinous Judgments; the Miniſtery of Chriſt diſhonoured was a juſt prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the way to that great deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and a higheſt juſtification of ſo ſevere a ſtroke. The Goſpel ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured is as a wall of fire for defence, and breaks outward upon the enemies of a Nation; when it is deſpiſed, it burns inward: It is a pillar of fire, and a cloud of protection when obſerved; but diſregarded, it is a cloud troubled with a Thunderbolt, rolling up and down, and at laſt flaſhing out in Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to deſtroy.</p>
            <p>Nothing delivers the Hiſtory of any time ſo fair to poſterity, as an honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble entertainment of a pure and unmix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Religion, giving it the utmoſt free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:59784:133"/> to ſhine as the Sun, to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate it ſelf as the air, and to run like the Fountains without any interruption: For as theſe, ſo the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt is the common happineſs, and neceſſiety of the world, from no Nation of which wherever it had place, hath it uſed to remove, but it hath carried the honour, and peace reſiding there with it, as the Glory together with the Ark departed from <hi>Iſrael,</hi> leaving it as naked of preſent happineſs, as of the hopes of eternal.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XX. <hi>The Reduction of the whole to a Concluſion.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>SEeing all things of general impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, do moſt liberally allow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to particulars, and enrich them with their abundance; every thing we have aſſerted of Judgments, is to be meaſured out in due proportions to this, and that Age: and ours preſent hath a peculiar Right, becauſe the Judgments of God have made a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:59784:133"/> reſidence upon it, and theſe years laſt paſt been ſigned with unuſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al prints of his Hand.</p>
            <p>I doubt not there is prophane wit enough in the world to refuſe with ſcorn whatever ſhall be offered by addreſſes much more potent then this; eſpecially encouraged by any ſmoother motion of affairs, or a peace, the very name of which is laden with the hopes of proſperity.</p>
            <p>It is alſo moſt true, that whoever in general ſets his heart to ſeek and find out all the Works of God in the world, while he ballances times and ſeaſons, and weighs out proſperity and adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, ſhall find much more then he can comprehend; for the paths of God turn aſide ſuddenly from humane thoughts, and divinations, that a man is ſtill put upon new inquiries, even then when he imagines he hath found. <hi>Solomon</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, there are that ſee not ſleep day or night, but labour to ſeek out the Work of God under the Sun, yet they cannot find it; yea further, though a wiſe man think to know it, yet ſhall he not be able to find it.</p>
            <pb n="218" facs="tcp:59784:134"/>
            <p> Notwithſtanding this, we are to mind the times, and the ſigns of them, every thing being beautiful in its ſeaſon, and having a fitneſs in its own place: ſo that there ariſe from it ſuch Phaſes or Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, which like the Sun<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Moon, and Stars, are for ſigns and ſeaſons: and in this ſenſe to diſtinguiſh days and years; from whence by the guidance of the Spirit of God, we may diſcern both time and Judgment, if we are thoſe that fear before him; while wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ungodly men, like fiſhes and birds, are caught and ſnared in an evil time, when it falleth ſuddenly upon them. Moreover he that obſerves the Government of the world, ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, as we have already obſerved, that there is an uſual clemency by which God either lays not on his hand when there are great corruptions, or takes it off, and quiets times: and yet no general repentances or amendments, or but very Ceremonial ſhews of them. This <hi>Jonah</hi> pleaded, as the reaſon of his diſobedience in not publiſhing the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Revelation of <hi>Ninevehs</hi> ruine. I know that thou art a Gracious God, and
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:59784:134"/> merciful, ſlow to anger, and of great kindneſs, and repenteſt thee of the evil. How incertain then muſt their conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures of Gods puniſhments be, that have no ſuch denunciations to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh?</p>
            <p>Yet ſtill upon the grand Principles of the Doctrine of Judgments, we have great cauſe to apprehend the condition of this Nation.</p>
            <p>For firſt, acknowledging the evils we have felt to be from God; and that we muſt aſcribe them to him, as to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor; we muſt alſo conclude he hath inflicted them upon us with higheſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and deſign; ſeeing he can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but according to that will, which hath an infinite Counſel, more intimate to it then the faculties of reaſon and will to mans Soul; and the reſults of which never cleave aſunder, as ours do, into thoſe of an underſtanding rightly guided, and thoſe other of an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding darkned with paſſion, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominated by inordinate appetite.</p>
            <p>Now none of the Reaſons of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we have given are perfected, but in Reformation, or ſome conſiſtency of
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:59784:135"/> Judgment, that remains as a monument of it ſo abſolute, that it hath no further occaſion of moving it ſelf; the triumphs of it glorying over all, except ſuch remnants as reſemble the poor people left of the Jews after the Captivation of every thing great into <hi>Babylon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt end is Reformation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the ſnare that is laid ſhall not be taken up, becauſe nothing is taken by it.</p>
            <p>How little Reformation we can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to, we are all ſufficient witneſſes againſt our ſelves, and may be judged out of our own mouths. For as the great complaints of humane Nature againſt it ſelf argue it all in a lapſe; ſo the general out-cryes of the ſeveral par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a Nation againſt one another, and all againſt the whole, concerning the inefficacy of Judgments, are ſtrong arguments we are unreformed; there being ſuch a Criterion of theſe things in the Civil, as there is of the natural body within it ſelf touching its ſtate.</p>
            <p>How many of the marks of danger muſt we needs ſee upon our ſelves, in regard of the evils Judgments have
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:59784:135"/> branded us with, and made them the ſigns of our times: Theſe three laſt years have ſtood loaden with ſo many Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, raiſed like Pyramids upon them.</p>
            <p>That of a Plague began the account, wherein the mouth of the Grave open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo wide, as if it would have drawn down all the living. This Hell (as that in the Prophet) in larged it ſelf without meaſure, that the multitude might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend into it. Death upon the pale Horſe conteſted for Empire, and Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, like a Cloud, ſpread it ſelf ſo wide, that it ſhaded life it ſelf. This hath ever been accounted a Judgment of the firſt three, an unqueſtionable meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger of the diſpleaſure of Heaven: the entrance into the Grave by it being not only moſt dreadful for the voraciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it, but moſt abhorred to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, for the poyſon of that exhalation that annoys the Vaults, and defiles the duſt of Death beyond its or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary loathſomneſs.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond of theſe years, God calls to contend by Fire, and it devours as it were the great Deep: This is the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:59784:136"/> uſual Emblem of the ſevereſt Acts of God; it is the laſt of Judgments upon the world, to which it is reſerved. Scripture oft makes uſe of a Deluge to ſignifie deſtruction by it, God having already uſed it to ſo great a deſolation of all things: Yet is it leſs expreſſive of his utmoſt indignation, ſeeing he renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſtate of Earth after it; which is finally deſtroyed by Fire, and that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver quenched is the deſcription of eternal wrath.</p>
            <p>With theſe two run parallel a Naval War, which divine Providence uſes as a State-conſumption, that is ever inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating a ſilent and inſenſible Fate, beſides thoſe noiſes and ſlaughters; into which it ever and anon ruſhes out, that it may give more publick Allarms of death.</p>
            <p>This the laſt year approaches us, like a dying hour, or a laſt gaſp, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it were the common Grave of our Glory, Riches, and Liberty, and caſt a blackeſt cloud upon the time on which it fell, and dwelt with as great a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour on it, as any of the former.</p>
            <p>All theſe made up to the very head and top of the Nation, where they fixed
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:59784:136"/> themſelves, as if they had that Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to fight neither with ſmall or great, but the Metropolis; whither by degrees ruines have at other times contended, and at laſt made their reſt: But theſe like Apoplectick diſeaſes ſurprized the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret of Nature at the firſt, and deſcended with ſtupefaction upon the whole: And though ſo much hath been ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by that Goodneſs which delights not in immediate ruines, as ſerves to adminiſter ſpirits to the body; yet all theſe are threats of what would imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately enſue, if there were a total op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of that Magazin of life; every offer at which is much more dangerous then heavier down-falls upon leſs noble parts, and ſpeak ſevereſt intentions of that diſpleaſure that cut us ſo deep in that head or one neck.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, if we ſhould appeal to the Prognoſticks of the moſt ſober Breaſts upon the preſent Scheme of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, would they not be very trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling? ſeeing beſides the incertainty what a day may bring forth, we look more like a people reprieved, then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored and ſetled.</p>
            <pb n="224" facs="tcp:59784:137"/>
            <p> Yet greater Symptoms of danger are thoſe our ſins diſcover upon us, and theſe not ſoftned or mitigated with thoſe things, that may ſtay off the blow ſo much as from our own days.</p>
            <p>If then we can neither deny thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral appearances of Judgment, nor ſay, that God doth any thing without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, nor plead our own Reformation, how can we but expect the ſucceſſions of Judgment, till there be ſome evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent determination of things by them, which yet may be hid and concealed in a preſent Truce: under the favour of which our affairs may eſſay a motion back to their reſt, and that boſom of peace, which when it is firm, opens to receive all publick and private Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts into it ſelf, that there they may be cheriſhed after a long languor.</p>
            <p>It is ſufficiently known; Judgments may intermit, and ſuſpend themſelves though they intend their own retrieve, as a ſnare is taken up that hath taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that it may be more convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly placed, and at a better time: Or as a Diſcourſe that hath ſeveral full points, and yet begins afreſh, till the whole be
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:59784:137"/> compleated; or like the Cockatrice ſpringing from the root of the Serpent, that ſeemed dead. For the Judgments of God take their own leaſure, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover themſelves at ſuch diſtances of time as ſeem meet to them, ſporting as it were with humane affairs, yet always including thoſe benigne and ſerious mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals of patience leading to repentance.</p>
            <p>Yea Interpoſals of mercy may have place, when deſtruction ſhall yet be the laſt act. Thus <hi>Iſrael</hi> delivered from <hi>Egypt,</hi> was in that Generation deſtroyed in the Wilderneſs. <hi>Hoſeahs</hi> Prophecy of the final Captivity of the ten Tribes, took its beginning under the Reign of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the Second, wherein that Kingdom was in a hopeful poſture.</p>
            <p>We our ſelves have ſeen the ſtate of our Nation, triumphing back to its own Center, where alone it could be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſtay, and fix after ſo long, and uneaſie an Anarchy; and yet how ſoon have we ſeen it trembling upon that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Center, and full of new perplexity?</p>
            <p>If mercies then leave us inſecured, what will any of the vain confidences and good hopes of men avail, which we
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:59784:138"/> ſee in no caſe can ward from evil, but as refuges of lyes ſurrender themſelves, and the perſons intruſted to them to that overflowing ſcourge, that paſſes along and ſweeps before it; for things of reality, and grounded upon certain cauſes, keep their way, and maintain their greatneſs, never conſidering whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are believed, and looked for before-hand or not.</p>
            <p>But which way ſoever it ſhall pleaſe the great Ruler of all things to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand our affairs, or what hand ſoever he ſhall guide them with, either of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy or Judgment; we have great reaſon with attent conſideration, to behold ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his ſeverity or his goodneſs, ſo as to move us home to him: If it ſhould be unexpected and undeſerved good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that like a <hi>melior natura</hi> ballances and diſpoſes thoſe ſeeds of Boute-feu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions rolling in our bowels, that out of them may ariſe a happy Univerſe, which elſe would in their contracts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy each other, and expoſe all to flames; yet this goodneſs is to be feared, that we may continue in it. For no Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the root that bears mercy; it will
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:59784:138"/> be mercy though we periſh: But it is mercy bears up all humane condition, which hangs like a ball in the air, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by infinite kindneſs.</p>
            <p>It is the great miracle we are preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, not that we are in diſtreſs, being ſo apt to danger, that we are cruſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the moth; ſo worthleſs, that we periſh by multitudes without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding it: Laſtly, ſo guilty, that all Creatures in Heaven and Earth give their applauſe to divine Judgments up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us; which are unwilling to proceed, till the ſtone cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber anſwer it; that is, till the moſt inſenſible things are ready to joyn with, and even provoke them up.</p>
            <p>If then mercy carries all our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, what reaſon have we to revere it?</p>
            <p>Nor is mercy leſs wiſe and holy, of ſmaller counſel and intention, then Judgment. In God it is not a ſoftneſs of Nature, or indulgence to ſin; it is not reſembled by the tenderneſs of a weak, but of a ſevere and wiſe man: and therefore is not to be trifled with.</p>
            <p>It is true indeed, the womb of mercy
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:59784:139"/> is infinitely pregnant; if it were not hindered by our ſins, it would be to thouſands; if it made up its circle, and were not interrupted in its courſe, it would be from everlaſting to everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: but then the hearts of men muſt be ſuppled, and oyl'd, ſweetned, and purified by it; the reaſons of it muſt be purſued, that it may not be abuſed: for it delivers at laſt into the hand of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, when it is neglected and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyed; it accompliſhes dreadful ends upon thoſe that deſpiſe it, giving them opportunity to treaſure up wrath againſt the day of wrath; and thoſe that hate its counſels, are repaid even to the third and fourth Generation, in the days wherein the righteous Judgments of God reveal themſelves.</p>
            <p>Seeing then that the ends of all Gods diſpoſes are, that the world may par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take his Holineſs; if he uſes the ſoft arguments of favour towards us after thoſe of diſpleaſure, is it not a ſin of the greateſt aggravation to contemn the riches of his goodneſs? For it either argues this kind of Atheiſm, that men take all the good they receive for the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:59784:139"/> courſe of Nature, and kinder conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of contingencies, and ſo regard not the work of Gods hand; and theſe God deſtroys, and will not build up: or elſe, which is a greater Atheiſm, it is, as if we ſhould ſay, we are delivered to do all theſe abominations.</p>
            <p>To ſin againſt mercy, ſhews an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding obduracy of men in ſin, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will take them off; for mercy is the proper argument (the cords) of a man; he kicks againſt bowels that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends it; it ſhews the greateſt ſenſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, that men turn all that way, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> gave thoſe good things to their Idols, which they received from God. In ſuch a caſe nothing remains, but that God vindicate himſelf by Judgments.</p>
            <p>Theſe things I have ſubjoyned con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning mercy to a Diſcourſe of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with a proſpect upon the hopes of a more proſperous condition, and in meditation of that of <hi>Ezra,</hi> After all this is come upon us for our evil deeds and great treſpaſſes: Seeing that thou, O our God, haſt puniſhed us leſs then our iniquities deſerve, and given us a
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:59784:140"/> breathing, ſhould we go on to break thy Commandements, and to continue our ſtrict alliances with former abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations? Wouldſt thou not be angry with us till thou hadſt conſumed us? ſo that there ſhould be no remnant, or eſcaping.</p>
            <p>But alas! ſeeing one ſinner deſtroys much good, and we ſee them with their ſins by multitudes thronging into the broad light, while in publick appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance we have very little of the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations againſt Judgments, or the uſual reaſons of their ſuſpenſions, how can we but fear our clouds ſhould return after the rain, till we are puniſhed to ſeven times more?</p>
            <p>Yet becauſe there are better hopes, though retired into the ſecret cloſets and corners, we may not deſpair a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation from utter ruine through that Myſtery of Providence, to be obſerved in the Government of the world; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God without that deſolation, by which States are daſhed in pieces like a Potters veſſel, redeems their converts with the Righteouſneſs and Judgment he executes, purges away their droſs
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:59784:140"/> and Tin by the ſpirit of burning, exciting the fire to a juſt intention to ſuch an end, purifies them ſeven times in the ſeven-fold puniſhment, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſtates them in Glory, and over that Glory creates a defence.</p>
            <p>Let us now hear the concluſion of the whole matter, which is, That God hath not only a time to judge every work of every ſingle perſon, but he hath appointed ſeaſons now to judge whole Nations, not ſo properly capable of that future Judgment. This falls out at certain periods ordained by him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſtrict meaſure of time (even to half an hour) which doth not only bring forth Events deſigned to it, but even exacts, and calls for them.</p>
            <p>It is then the whole Duty and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of Nations to fear before him, to keep his Commandements, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance his Glory and Truth, by not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending with, but obeying it.</p>
            <p>This concluſion is ſo indented with the mind, that it more cloſely twines with it, then that circuit of reaſon uſed to demonſtrate it, and more ſpeedily riſes up out of the confeſſion of the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:59784:141"/> Soul, then thoſe Engines that are fit to raiſe it can be applyed. So that of making many Books or long Diſcourſes there is no end: Yet becauſe the mind reſting upon its own concluſion, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging alſo upon the whole circle of truth about it, ſtands both better to view, and with more benefit collects practical inference from it; it is good to take the advantage of what may be ſubſervient hereunto.</p>
